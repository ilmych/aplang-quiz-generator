He was a gay\n\nand impudent and satirical and delightful young black man - a slave - who daily\n\npreached sermons from the top of his master's woodpile, with me for the sole 5\n\naudience. He imitated the pulpit style of the several clergymen of the village, and\n\ndid it well, and with fine passion and energy. To me he was a wonder. I believed\n\nhe was the greatest orator in the United States and would some day be heard\n\nfrom. But it did not happen; in the distribution of rewards he was overlooked. It is\n\nthe way, in this world. 10\n\nI listened to the sermons from the open window of a lumber room at the back of\n\nthe house. One of his texts was this: \"You tell me whar a man gets his corn pone, en\n\nI'Il tell you what his 'pinions is.\"\n\nI can never forget it. It was deeply impressed upon me. By my mother. Not upon\n\nmy memory, but elsewhere. She had slipped in upon me while I was absorbed and 15\n\nnot watching. The black philosopher's idea was that a man is not independent, and\n\ncannot afford views which might interfere with his bread and butter. If he would\n\nprosper, he must train with the majority; in matters of large moment, like politics\n\nand religion, he must think and feel with the bulk of his neighbors, or suffer damage\n\nin his social standing and in his business prosperities. He must restrict himself to 20\n\ncorn-pone opinions - at least on the surface. He must get his opinions from other\n\npeople; he must reason out none for himself; he must have no first hand views.\n\nI think Jerry was right, in the main, but I think he did not go far enough.\n\n1. It was his idea that a man conforms to the majority view of his locality by not the\n\ncalculation and intention. 25\n\nThis happens, but I think it is not the rule.\n\n2. It was his idea that there is such a thing as a first-hand opinion; an original\n\nopinion; an opinion which is coldly reasoned out in a man's head, by a searching\n\nanalysis of the facts involved, with the heart unconsulted, and the jury room closed\n\nagainst outside influences. 30\n\nIt may be that such an opinion has been born somewhere, at some time or other,\n\nbut I suppose it got away before they could catch it and stuff it and put it in a\n\nmuseum.\n\nI am persuaded that a coldly-thought-out and independent verdict upon a fashion in\n\nclothes, or manners, or literature, or politics, or religion, or any other matter that is 35\n\nprojected into the field of our notice and interest, is a most rare thing - if it indeed\n\never existed. A new thing in costume appears - the flaring hoopskirt, for example -\n\nand the passers-by are shocked, and the irreverent laugh. Six months later\n\neverybody is reconciled; the fashion has established itself; it is admired, now, and\n\nno one laughs. Public opinion resented it before, public opinion accepts it now, and 40\n\nis happy in it. Why? Was the resentment reasoned out? Was the acceptance\n\nreasoned out? No. The instinct that moves to conformity did the work. It is our\n\nnature to conform; it is a force which not many can successfully resist. What is its\n\nseat? The inborn requirement of self-approval. We all have to bow to that; there are\n\nno exceptions. Even the woman who refuses from first to last to wear the hoopskirt 45\n\ncomes under that law and is its slave; she could not wear the skirt and have her own\n\napproval; and that she must have, she cannot help herself. But as a rule our self-\n\napproval has its source in but one place and not elsewhere - the approval of other\n\npeople.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly speaking, 50\n\ncorn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is acquired mainly from the\n\napproval of other people. The result is conformity. Sometimes conformity has a\n\nsordid business interest - the bread-and-butter interest -but not in most cases, I\n\nthink. I think that in the majority of cases it is unconscious and not calculated; that\n\nit is born of the human being's natural yearning to stand well with his fellows and 55\n\nhave their inspiring approval and praise - a yearning which is commonly so strong\n\nand so insistent that it cannot be effectually resisted, and must have its way.",

        "referenceText": "Fifty years ago, when I was a boy of fifteen and helping to inhabit a Missourian\n\nvillage on the banks of the Mississippi, I had a friend whose society was very\n\ndear to me because I was forbidden by my mother to partake of it. He was a gay\n\nand impudent and satirical and delightful young black man - a slave - who daily\n\npreached sermons from the top of his master's woodpile, with me for the sole 5\n\naudience. He imitated the pulpit style of the several clergymen of the village, and\n\ndid it well, and with fine passion and energy. To me he was a wonder. I believed\n\nhe was the greatest orator in the United States and would some day be heard\n\nfrom. But it did not happen; in the distribution of rewards he was overlooked. It is\n\nthe way, in this world. 10\n\nI listened to the sermons from the open window of a lumber room at the back of\n\nthe house. One of his texts was this: \"You tell me whar a man gets his corn pone, en\n\nI'Il tell you what his 'pinions is.\"\n\nI can never forget it. It was deeply impressed upon me. By my mother. Not upon\n\nmy memory, but elsewhere. She had slipped in upon me while I was absorbed and 15\n\nnot watching. The black philosopher's idea was that a man is not independent, and\n\ncannot afford views which might interfere with his bread and butter. If he would\n\nprosper, he must train with the majority; in matters of large moment, like politics\n\nand religion, he must think and feel with the bulk of his neighbors, or suffer damage\n\nin his social standing and in his business prosperities. He must restrict himself to 20\n\ncorn-pone opinions - at least on the surface. He must get his opinions from other\n\npeople; he must reason out none for himself; he must have no first hand views.\n\nI think Jerry was right, in the main, but I think he did not go far enough.\n\n1. It was his idea that a man conforms to the majority view of his locality by not the\n\ncalculation and intention. 25\n\nThis happens, but I think it is not the rule.\n\n2. It was his idea that there is such a thing as a first-hand opinion; an original\n\nopinion; an opinion which is coldly reasoned out in a man's head, by a searching\n\nanalysis of the facts involved, with the heart unconsulted, and the jury room closed\n\nagainst outside influences. 30\n\nIt may be that such an opinion has been born somewhere, at some time or other,\n\nbut I suppose it got away before they could catch it and stuff it and put it in a\n\nmuseum.\n\nI am persuaded that a coldly-thought-out and independent verdict upon a fashion in\n\nclothes, or manners, or literature, or politics, or religion, or any other matter that is 35\n\nprojected into the field of our notice and interest, is a most rare thing - if it indeed\n\never existed. A new thing in costume appears - the flaring hoopskirt, for example -\n\nand the passers-by are shocked, and the irreverent laugh. Six months later\n\neverybody is reconciled; the fashion has established itself; it is admired, now, and\n\nno one laughs. Public opinion resented it before, public opinion accepts it now, and 40\n\nis happy in it. Why? Was the resentment reasoned out? Was the acceptance\n\nreasoned out? No. The instinct that moves to conformity did the work. It is our\n\nnature to conform; it is a force which not many can successfully resist. What is its\n\nseat? The inborn requirement of self-approval. We all have to bow to that; there are\n\nno exceptions. Even the woman who refuses from first to last to wear the hoopskirt 45\n\ncomes under that law and is its slave; she could not wear the skirt and have her own\n\napproval; and that she must have, she cannot help herself. But as a rule our self-\n\napproval has its source in but one place and not elsewhere - the approval of other\n\npeople.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly speaking, 50\n\ncorn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is acquired mainly from the\n\napproval of other people. The result is conformity. Sometimes conformity has a\n\nsordid business interest - the bread-and-butter interest -but not in most cases, I\n\nthink. I think that in the majority of cases it is unconscious and not calculated; that\n\nit is born of the human being's natural yearning to stand well with his fellows and 55\n\nhave their inspiring approval and praise - a yearning which is commonly so strong\n\nand so insistent that it cannot be effectually resisted, and must have its way.",

As students of rhetoric, you are to some extent conditioned to expect an entreaty of this kind at the beginning of a text, but here the author does not extend a hand to the reader--far from it. He suggests a revolutionary proposition, knowing that his readers could very well be shocked by the notion. \n<strong>Choice 'C'</strong>, then, is the only possible answer.
