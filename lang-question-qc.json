Essential Formatting\n- Are titles formatted in a clear and consistent way? (Either italics or quotes are acceptable if used consistently)\n- Is emphasis (bold/italic) used in a way that aids rather than hinders reading?\n- Are quotations marked clearly and consistently?\n\n2. Structure and Readability\n- Is the passage properly organized with appropriate paragraph breaks?\n- Are any footnotes, line numbers, or references clearly marked?\n- Is the overall formatting clean and readable?\n\n3. Basic Consistency\n- Are similar elements formatted similarly within the passage?\n- Do any variations in style serve a clear purpose?\n- Is the formatting professional and appropriate for an exam context?\n\nGuidelines:\n- Minor variations in style are acceptable if they don't impact readability\n- Different but consistent approaches to formatting (e.g., straight vs curly quotes) are acceptable\n- Technical elements like em dashes and ellipses can vary if used consistently within the passage\n- Focus on whether the formatting supports clear communication of the content\n\nOutput Format:\n<answer>\n{{\n  \"score\": [1 if formatting supports readability and maintains basic consistency, 0 if significant issues impair comprehension],\n  \"reasoning\": [1-2 sentences explaining the evaluation]\n}}\n</answer>\n\nNote: The goal is to ensure formatting supports rather than hinders understanding, not to enforce rigid stylistic rules."

Your task is to determine whether a distractor (incorrect answer choice) meets MINIMUM standards for plausibility in an AP Language exam context.\n\nInput:\n{json.dumps(input_json, indent=2)}\n\nEvaluation Process:\n1. Consider ANY connection to the passage or question that might make this distractor tempting:\n   * Does it reference ANY element actually present in the passage?\n   * Does it use language similar to the passage in ANY way?\n   * Does it address the topic of the question, even tangentially?\n   * Does it sound analytical, academic, or plausibly correct at first glance?\n\n2. Look for ANY basis for choosing this distractor:\n   * Might a student who misreads part of the passage select this?\n   * Could someone who misunderstands the question's focus choose this?\n   * Would a student with partial understanding of rhetoric be drawn to this?\n   * Is there ANY interpretive path that could lead to this answer?\n\n3. Consider the broadest possible definition of plausibility:\n   * The distractor doesn't need to be highly plausible - just minimally defensible\n   * It doesn't need to be tightly connected to the text - just not completely unrelated\n   * It can represent a significant misreading as long as it's a misreading a student might make\n   * It can be a stretch but shouldn't be completely arbitrary\n   * Almost ANY distractor that relates to the passage in ANY way meets the minimum standard\n\nDECISION RULE:\n* If the distractor has ANY connection to the passage OR question, it PASSES (score=1)\n* If the distractor is COMPLETELY unrelated to both the passage AND question, it FAILS (score=0)\n\n<answer>\n{{\n    \"score\": [1 if the distractor has ANY connection to the passage or question, 0 if completely unrelated],\n    \"reasoning\": [1-2 sentences explaining your determination]\n}}\n</answer>\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n- PASS any distractor that references elements from the text, even if misinterpreted\n- PASS any distractor that uses language or concepts from the passage\n- PASS any distractor that represents a misreading a student might reasonably make\n- PASS any distractor that has any defensible connection to the question\n- PASS any distractor that partially addresses the question, even if incorrectly\n- PASS any distractor that uses academic or analytical language related to the topic\n- FAIL ONLY if the distractor is COMPLETELY arbitrary and unrelated to both passage and question\n- When in doubt, PASS the distractor - it is most likely plausible enough if you're in doubt"

First, precisely identify what the question is asking for:\n   * What specific textual element, rhetorical device, or analytical judgment is required?\n   * What level of inference or analytical thinking is needed?\n   * Is the question asking about purpose, effect, function, meaning, or relationship?\n\n2. Evaluate the correct answer against the question requirements:\n   * Does it directly address what the question is asking?\n   * Is it supported by specific textual evidence?\n   * Does it accurately characterize the element being analyzed?\n   * Is it properly scoped (neither too broad nor too narrow)?\n\n3. Compare each distractor to the correct answer:\n   * Does the correct answer more directly address the question than each distractor?\n   * Is there clear textual evidence that supports the correct answer over each distractor?\n   * Are there clear analytical reasons why the correct answer is superior?\n   * Would a well-prepared student be able to confidently select the correct answer?\n\n4. Look for potential ambiguity or overlap:\n   * Could any distractor be defended as equally valid given a reasonable reading of the text?\n   * Do any distractors contain elements that are partially correct in ways that make them competitive with the correct answer?\n   * Are there multiple interpretations of the question that could lead to different answers?\n   * Does the question contain vague language that allows for multiple valid responses?\n\n5. Consider authentic student interpretations:\n   * Would skilled AP students converge on the identified correct answer?\n   * Are the distinctions between correct and incorrect answers based on legitimate analytical differences rather than semantic technicalities?\n   * Is the superiority of the correct answer based on meaningful understanding rather than arbitrary distinctions?\n\nDECISION RULE:\nFor the question to PASS (score=1), ALL of these must be true:\n* The correct answer directly addresses what the question asks\n* The correct answer is clearly superior to all distractors based on textual evidence\n* No distractor could be reasonably defended as equally valid\n* The distinctions between correct and incorrect answers reflect meaningful analytical differences\n\n<answer>\n{{\n    \"score\": [1 if exactly one definitively correct answer, 0 if multiple defensible answers or no clearly correct answer],\n    \"reasoning\": [1-2 sentences explaining your determination]\n}}\n</answer>\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n- Questions should pass unless there is a clear problem with answer uniqueness\n- Different analytical approaches can still lead to a single best answer\n- Allow for reasonable inference as long as textual support exists\n- The correct answer doesn't need to be perfect - it just needs to be clearly best\n- When comparing answers, focus on meaningful distinctions related to the skill being tested\n- Slight imprecisions in language don't necessarily create ambiguity if the intent is clear\n- The standard is \"best answer\" not \"perfect answer\" - the correct option should be demonstrably better than the alternatives\n- When in doubt about whether multiple answers could be correct, check if well-prepared students would consistently select the same answer"

Functional Variation Assessment\n   - For ALL question types, determine if structural variations serve a legitimate purpose:\n     * For revision questions: variations that demonstrate different approaches are EXPECTED and ACCEPTABLE\n     * For sentence insertion questions: variations in structure may be NECESSARY to show different placement options\n     * For rhetorical analysis: variations that reflect different analytical approaches are ACCEPTABLE\n     * For word choice questions: variations that demonstrate different rhetorical effects are EXPECTED\n\n3.
