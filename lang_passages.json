        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Each of these passages has faults of its own, but quite apart from avoidable ugliness, two qualities are common to all of them. The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else, or he is almost indifferent as to whether his words mean anything or not. This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of words chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of phrases tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen\u2212house. I list below, with notes and examples, various of the tricks by means of which the work of prose\u2212construction is habitually dodged:</p><br><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Dying metaphors</em>. A newly\u2212invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically \"dead\" (e.g., iron resolution) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn\u2212out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are: Ring the changes on, take up the cudgels for, toe the line, ride roughshod over, stand shoulder to shoulder with, play into the hands of, an axe to grind, grist to the mill, fishing in troubled waters, on the order of the day, Achilles' heel, swan song, hotbed. Many of these are used without knowledge of their meaning (what is a \"rift,\" for instance?), and incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying. Some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, toe the line is sometimes written tow the line. Another example is the hammer and the anvil, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying would be aware of this, and would avoid perverting the original phrase.</p><br><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Operators, or verbal false limbs</em>. These save the trouble of picking out appropriate verbs and nouns, and at the same time pad each sentence with extra syllables which give it an appearance of symmetry. Characteristic phrases are: render inoperative, militate against, prove unacceptable, make contact with, be subjected to, give rise to, give grounds for, having the effect of, play a leading part (role) in, make itself felt, take effect, exhibit a tendency to, serve the purpose of, etc., etc. The keynote is the elimination of simple verbs. Instead of being a single word, such as break, stop, spoil, mend, kill, a verb becomes a phrase, made up of a noun or adjective tacked on to some general\u2212purposes verb as prove, serve, form, play, render. In addition, the passive voice is wherever possible used in preference to the active, and noun constructions are used instead of gerunds (by examination of instead of by examining). The range of verbs is further cut down by means of the \u2212ize and de\u2212 formations, and banal statements are given an appearance of profundity by means of the not un\u2212 formation. Simple conjunctions and prepositions are replaced by such phrases as with respect to, having regard to, the fact that, by dint of, in view of, in the interests of, on the hypothesis that; and the ends of sentences are saved from anti\u2212climax by such resounding commonplaces as greatly to be desired, cannot be left out of account, a development to be expected in the near future, deserving of serious consideration, brought to a satisfactory conclusion, and so on and so forth.</p><br><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Pretentious diction</em>. Words like phenomenon, element, individual (as noun), objective, categorical, effective, virtual, basis, primary, promote, constitute, exhibit, exploit, utilize, eliminate, liquidate, are used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments. Adjectives like epoch\u2212making, epic, historic, unforgettable, triumphant, age\u2212old, inevitable, inexorable, veritable, are used to dignify the sordid processes of international politics, while writing that aims at glorifying war usually takes on an archaic color, its characteristic words being: realm, throne, chariot, mailed fist, trident, sword, shield, buckler, banner, jackboot, clarion. Foreign words and expressions such as cul de sac, ancien regime, deus ex machina, mutatis mutandis, status quo, gleichschaltung, weltanschauung, are used to give an air of culture and elegance. Except for the useful abbreviations i.e., e.g., and etc., there is no real need for any of the hundreds of foreign phrases now current in English. Bad writers, and especially scientific, political and sociological writers, are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine, subaqueous and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their Anglo\u2212Saxon opposite numbers.</p><br><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The jargon peculiar to Marxist writing (hyena, hangman, cannibal, petty bourgeois, these gentry, lackey, flunkey, mad dog, White Guard, etc.) consists largely of words and phrases translated from Russian, German or French; but the normal way of coining a new word is to use a Latin or Greek root with the appropriate affix and, where necessary, the \u2212ize formation. It is often easier to make up words of this kind (de\u2212regionalize, impermissible, extramarital, non\u2212fragmentary and so forth) than to think up the English words that will cover one's meaning. The result, in general, is an increase in slovenliness and vagueness.</p><br><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>An interesting illustration of this is the way in which the English flower names which were in use till very recently are being ousted by Greek ones, snap\u2212dragon becoming antirrhinum, forget\u2212me\u2212not becoming myosotis, etc. It is hard to see any practical reason for this change of fashion: it is probably due to an instinctive turning\u2212away from the more homely word and a vague feeling that the Greek word is scientific.</p><br><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Meaningless words</em>. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. Words like romantic, plastic, values, human, dead, sentimental, natural, vitality, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, \"The outstanding feature of Mr. X's work is its living quality,\" while another writes, \"The immediately striking thing about Mr. X's work is its peculiar deadness, the reader accepts this as a simple difference of opinion If words like black and white were involved, instead of the jargon words dead and living, he would see at once that language was being used in an improper way. Many political words are similarly abused. The word Fascism has now no meaning except in so far as it signifies \"something not desirable.\" The words democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice, have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like democracy, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of r\u00e9gime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like Marshal P\u00e9tain was a true patriot, The Soviet Press is the freest in the world, The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution, are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly, are: class, totalitarian, science, progressive, reactionary bourgeois, equality.</p>\n",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, it is rather strange and paradoxical to find us consciously breaking laws. One may well ask, \"How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?\" The answer is found in the fact that there are two types of laws: there are just laws, and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that \"An unjust law is no law at all.\" </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine when a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law, or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas, an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. To use the words of Martin Buber, the great Jewish philosopher, segregation substitutes an \"I -it\" relationship for the \"I -thou\" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. So segregation is not only politically, economically, and sociologically unsound, but it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Isn't segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, an expression of his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? So I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court because it is morally right, and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances because they are morally wrong. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Let us turn to a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the other hand, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow, and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal. </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Let me give another explanation. An unjust law is a code inflicted upon a minority which that minority had no part in enacting or creating because it did not have the unhampered right to vote. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up the segregation laws was democratically elected? Throughout the state of Alabama all types of conniving methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties without a single Negro registered to vote, despite the fact that the Negroes constitute a majority of the population. Can any law set up in such a state be considered democratically structured? </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>These are just a few examples of unjust and just laws. There are some instances when a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I was arrested Friday on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong with an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade, but when the ordinance is used to preserve segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and peaceful protest, then it becomes unjust. </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was seen sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar because a higher moral law was involved. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks before submitting to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was \"legal\" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was \"illegal.\" It was \"illegal\" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. But I am sure that if I had lived in Germany during that time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal. If I lived in a Communist country today where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I believe I would openly advocate disobeying these anti-religious laws.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the streets.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the clothing of many thousands.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple, whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain a hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve years old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasee, or a ragoust.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.</p>\n",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Moths that fly by day are not properly to be called moths; they do not excite that pleasant sense of dark autumn nights and ivy-blossom which the commonest yellow-underwing asleep in the shadow of the curtain never fails to rouse in us. They are hybrid creatures, neither gay like butterflies nor sombre like their own species. Nevertheless the present specimen, with his narrow hay-coloured wings, fringed with a tassel of the same colour, seemed to be content with life. It was a pleasant morning, mid-September, mild, benignant, yet with a keener breath than that of the summer months. The plough was already scoring the field opposite the window, and where the share had been, the earth was pressed flat and gleamed with moisture. Such vigour came rolling in from the fields and the down beyond that it was difficult to keep the eyes strictly turned upon the book. The rooks too were keeping one of their annual festivities; soaring round the tree tops until it looked as if a vast net with thousands of black knots in it had been cast up into the air; which, after a few moments sank slowly down upon the trees until every twig seemed to have a knot at the end of it. Then, suddenly, the net would be thrown into the air again in a wider circle this time, with the utmost clamour and vociferation, as though to be thrown into the air and settle slowly down upon the tree tops were a tremendously exciting experience.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The same energy which inspired the rooks, the ploughmen, the horses, and even, it seemed, the lean bare-backed downs, sent the moth fluttering from side to side of his square of the window-pane. One could not help watching him. One was, indeed, conscious of a queer feeling of pity for him. The possibilities of pleasure seemed that morning so enormous and so various that to have only a moth's part in life, and a day moth's at that, appeared a hard fate, and his zest in enjoying his meagre opportunities to the full, pathetic. He flew vigorously to one corner of his compartment, and, after waiting there a second, flew across to the other. What remained for him but to fly to a third corner and then to a fourth? That was all he could do, in spite of the size of the downs, the width of the sky, the far-off smoke of houses, and the romantic voice, now and then, of a steamer out at sea. What he could do he did. Watching him, it seemed as if a fibre, very thin but pure, of the enormous energy of the world had been thrust into his frail and diminutive body. As often as he crossed the pane, I could fancy that a thread of vital light became visible. He was little or nothing but life.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yet, because he was so small, and so simple a form of the energy that was rolling in at the open window and driving its way through so many narrow and intricate corridors in my own brain and in those of other human beings, there was something marvellous as well as pathetic about him. It was as if someone had taken a tiny bead of pure life and decking it as lightly as possible with down and feathers, had set it dancing and zig-zagging to show us the true nature of life. Thus displayed one could not get over the strangeness of it. One is apt to forget all about life, seeing it humped and bossed and garnished and cumbered so that it has to move with the greatest circumspection and dignity. Again, the thought of all that life might have been had he been born in any other shape caused one to view his simple activities with a kind of pity.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>After a time, tired by his dancing apparently, he settled on the window ledge in the sun, and, the queer spectacle being at an end, I forgot about him. Then, looking up, my eye was caught by him. He was trying to resume his dancing, but seemed either so stiff or so awkward that he could only flutter to the bottom of the window-pane; and when he tried to fly across it he failed. Being intent on other matters I watched these futile attempts for a time without thinking, unconsciously waiting for him to resume his flight, as one waits for a machine, that has stopped momentarily, to start again without considering the reason of its failure. After perhaps a seventh attempt he slipped from the wooden ledge and fell, fluttering his wings, on to his back on the window sill. The helplessness of his attitude roused me. It flashed upon me that he was in difficulties; he could no longer raise himself; his legs struggled vainly. But, as I stretched out a pencil, meaning to help him to right himself, it came over me that the failure and awkwardness were the approach of death. I laid the pencil down again.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The legs agitated themselves once more. I looked as if for the enemy against which he struggled. I looked out of doors. What had happened there? Presumably it was midday, and work in the fields had stopped. Stillness and quiet had replaced the previous animation. The birds had taken themselves off to feed in the brooks. The horses stood still. Yet the power was there all the same, massed outside indifferent, impersonal, not attending to anything in particular. Somehow it was opposed to the little hay-coloured moth. It was useless to try to do anything. One could only watch the extraordinary efforts made by those tiny legs against an oncoming doom which could, had it chosen, have submerged an entire city, not merely a city, but masses of human beings; nothing, I knew, had any chance against death. Nevertheless after a pause of exhaustion the legs fluttered again. It was superb this last protest, and so frantic that he succeeded at last in righting himself. One's sympathies, of course, were all on the side of life. Also, when there was nobody to care or to know, this gigantic effort on the part of an insignificant little moth, against a power of such magnitude, to retain what no one else valued or desired to keep, moved one strangely. Again, somehow, one saw life, a pure bead. I lifted the pencil again, useless though I knew it to be. But even as I did so, the unmistakable tokens of death showed themselves. The body relaxed, and instantly grew stiff. The struggle was over. The insignificant little creature now knew death. As I looked at the dead moth, this minute wayside triumph of so great a force over so mean an antagonist filled me with wonder. Just as life had been strange a few minutes before, so death was now as strange. The moth having righted himself now lay most decently and uncomplainingly composed. O yes, he seemed to say, death is stronger than I am.</p>",

This that you have heard is the case of every one of you that are out of Christ.\u2014That world of misery, that lake of burning brimstone, is extended abroad under you. There is the dreadful pit of the glowing flames of the wrath of God; there is hell\u2019s wide gaping mouth open; and you have nothing to stand upon, nor any thing to take hold of; there is nothing between you and hell but the air; it is only the power and mere pleasure of God that holds you up.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You probably are not sensible of this; you find you are kept out of hell, but do not see the hand of God in it; but look at other things, as the good state of your bodily constitution, your care of your own life, and the means you use for your own preservation. But indeed these things are nothing; if God should withdraw his hand, they would avail no more to keep you from falling, than the thin air to hold up a person that is suspended in it.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Your wickedness makes you as it were heavy as lead, and to tend downwards with great weight and pressure towards hell; and if God should let you go, you would immediately sink and swiftly descend and plunge into the bottomless gulf, and your healthy constitution, and your own care and prudence, and best contrivance, and all your righteousness, would have no more influence to uphold you and keep you out of hell, than a spider\u2019s web would have to stop a falling rock. Were it not for the sovereign pleasure of God, the earth would not bear you one moment; for you are a burden to it; the creation groans with you; the creature is made subject to the bondage of your corruption, not willingly; the sun does not willingly shine upon you to give you light to serve sin and Satan; the earth does not willingly yield her increase to satisfy your lusts; nor is it willingly a stage for your wickedness to be acted upon; the air does not willingly serve you for breath to maintain the flame of life in your vitals, while you spend your life in the service of God\u2019s enemies. God\u2019s creatures are good, and were made for men to serve God with, and do not willingly subserve to any other purpose, and groan when they are abused to purposes so directly contrary to their nature and end. And the world would spew you out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath subjected it in hope. There are the black clouds of God\u2019s wrath now hanging directly over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big with thunder; and were it not for the restraining hand of God, it would immediately burst forth upon you. The sovereign pleasure of God, for the present, stays his rough wind; otherwise it would come with fury, and your destruction would come like a whirlwind, and you would be like the chaff of the summer threshing floor.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The wrath of God is like great waters that are dammed for the present; they increase more and more, and rise higher and higher, till an outlet is given; and the longer the stream is stopped, the more rapid and mighty is its course, when once it is let loose. It is true, that judgment against your evil works has not been executed hitherto; the floods of God\u2019s vengeance have been withheld; but your guilt in the mean time is constantly increasing, and you are every day treasuring up more wrath; the waters are constantly rising, and waxing more and more mighty; and there is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, that holds the waters back, that are unwilling to be stopped, and press hard to go forward. If God should only withdraw his hand from the flood-gate, it would immediately fly open, and the fiery floods of the fierceness and wrath of God, would rush forth with inconceivable fury, and would come upon you with omnipotent power; and if your strength were ten thousand times greater than it is, yea, ten thousand times greater than the strength of the stoutest, sturdiest devil in hell, it would be nothing to withstand or endure it.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The bow of God\u2019s wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string, and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of God, and that of an angry God, without any promise or obligation at all, that keeps the arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood. Thus all you that never passed under a great change of heart, by the mighty power of the Spirit of God upon your souls; all you that were never born again, and made new creatures, and raised from being dead in sin, to a state of new, and before altogether unexperienced light and life, are in the hands of an angry God. However you may have reformed your life in many things, and may have had religious affections, and may keep up a form of religion in your families and closets, and in the house of God, it is nothing but his mere pleasure that keeps you from being this moment swallowed up in everlasting destruction. However unconvinced you may now be of the truth of what you hear, by and by you will be fully convinced of it. Those that are gone from being in the like circumstances with you, see that it was so with them; for destruction came suddenly upon most of them; when they expected nothing of it, and while they were saying, Peace and safety: now they see, that those things on which they depended for peace and safety, were nothing but thin air and empty shadows.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self on which a universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct. We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin. For, the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the fountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom, and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions are but roving;--the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for, they do not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to see this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time, all mankind,--although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is profane to seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole. Whenever a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away,--means, teachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it,--one as much as another. All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, and, in the universal miracle, petty and particular miracles disappear. If, therefore, a man claims to know and speak of God, and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old mouldered nation in another country, in another world, believe him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and completion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being? Whence, then, this worship of the past? The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury, if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say 'I think,' 'I am,' but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself, unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they chance to see,--painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered these sayings, they understand them, and are willing to let the words go; for, at any time, they can use words as good when occasion comes. If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak. When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is not a man's duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous, wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency is tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, \"I should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves, or to march to Mexico;- see if I would go\"; and yet these very men have each, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by their money, furnished a substitute. The soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war; is applauded by those whose own act and authority he disregards and sets at naught; as if the state were penitent to that degree that it differed one to scourge it while it sinned, but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment. Thus, under the name of Order and Civil Government, we are all made at last to pay homage to and support our own meanness. After the first blush of sin comes its indifference; and from immoral it becomes, as it were, unmoral, and not quite unnecessary to that life which we have made. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested virtue to sustain it. The slight reproach to which the virtue of patriotism is commonly liable, the noble are most likely to incur. Those who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government, yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform. Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the Union, to disregard the requisitions of the President. Why do they notdissolve it themselves- the union between themselves and the State- and refuse to pay their quota into its treasury? Do not they stand in the same relation to the State that the State does to the Union? And have not the same reasons prevented the State from resisting the Union which have prevented them from resisting the State? </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>How can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoy it? Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is aggrieved? If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor, you do not rest satisfied with knowing that you are cheated, or with saying that you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay you your due; but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and see that you are never cheated again. Action from principle, the perception and the performance of right, changes things and relations; it is essentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with anything which was. It not only divides States and churches, it divides families; ay, it divides the individual, separating the diabolical in him from the divine. </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Unjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as this, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them. They think that, if they should resist, the remedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than the evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist before it is hurt? Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults, and do better than it would have them? Why does it always crucify Christ, and excommunicate Copernicus and Luther, and pronounce Washington and Franklin rebels? </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>One would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the only offence never contemplated by government; else, why has it not assigned its definite, its suitable and proportionate, penalty? If a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine shillings for the State, he is put in prison for a period unlimited by any law that I know, and determined only by the discretion of those who placed him there; but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings from the State, he is soon permitted to go at large again. </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear smooth- certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself, then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate,that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it. But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavour, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written. What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon him; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues, even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without religion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of any particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some time or other to publish it, I would not have anything in it that should prejudice anyone, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I should have called my book The Art of Virtue, because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does not instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed.\u2014James ii. 15, 16.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life, and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine, that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but forbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone considered; that it was, therefore, everyone's interest to be virtuous who wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance (there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortune as those of probity and integrity.</p>\n",

He stopped walking and the buildings of Waterbury rose up out of the misty courtroom and surrounded him again. A woman who was passing laughed. \"He said 'Puppy biscuit,'\" she said to her companion. \"That man said 'Puppy biscuit' to himself.\" Walter Mitty hurried on. He went into an A. & P., not the first one he came to but a smaller one farther up the street. \"I want some biscuit for small, young dogs,\" he said to the clerk. \"Any special brand, sir?\" The greatest pistol shot in the world thought a moment. \"It says 'Puppies Bark for It' on the box,\" said Walter Mitty.  His wife would be through at the hairdresser's in fifteen minutes' Mitty saw in looking at his watch, unless they had trouble drying it; sometimes they had trouble drying it. She didn't like to get to the hotel first, she would want him to be there waiting for her as usual. He found a big leather chair in the lobby, facing a window, and he put the overshoes and the puppy biscuit on the floor beside it. He picked up an old copy of Liberty and sank down into the chair. \"Can Germany Conquer the World Through the Air?\" Walter Mitty looked at the pictures of bombing planes and of ruined streets.  . . . \"The cannonading has got the wind up in young Raleigh, sir,\" said the sergeant. Captain Mitty looked up at him through tousled hair. \"Get him to bed,\" he said wearily, \"with the others. I'll fly alone.\" \"But you can't, sir,\" said the sergeant anxiously. \"It takes two men to handle that bomber and the Archies are pounding hell out of the air. Von Richtman's circus is between here and Saulier.\" \"Somebody's got to get that ammunition dump,\" said Mitty. \"I'm going over. Spot of brandy?\" He poured a drink for the sergeant and one for himself. War thundered and whined around the dugout and battered at the door. There was a rending of wood and splinters flew through the room. \"A bit of a near thing,\" said Captain Mitty carelessly. 'The box barrage is closing in,\" said the sergeant. \"We only live once, Sergeant,\" said Mitty, with his faint, fleeting smile. \"Or do we?\" He poured another brandy and tossed it off. \"I never see a man could hold his brandy like you, sir,\" said the sergeant. \"Begging your pardon, sir.\" Captain Mitty stood up and strapped on his huge Webley-Vickers automatic. \"It's forty kilometers through hell, sir,\" said the sergeant. Mitty finished one last brandy. \"After all,\" he said softly, \"what isn't?\" The pounding of the cannon increased; there was the rat-tattatting of machine guns, and from somewhere came the menacing pocketa-pocketa-pocketa of the new flame-throwers. Walter Mitty walked to the door of the dugout humming \"Aupres de Ma Blonde.\" He turned and waved to the sergeant. \"Cheerio!\" he said. . . .  </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Something struck his shoulder. \"I've been looking all over this hotel for you,\" said Mrs. Mitty. \"Why do you have to hide in this old chair? How did you expect me to find you?\" \"Things close in,\" said Walter Mitty vaguely. \"What?\" Mrs. Mitty said. \"Did you get the what's-itsname? The puppy biscuit? What's in that box?\" \"Overshoes,\" said Mitty. \"Couldn't you have put them on in the store?\" 'I was thinking,\" said Walter Mitty. \"Does it ever occur to you that I am sometimes thinking?\" She looked at him. \"I'm going to take your temperature when I get you home,\" she said.  </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>They went out through the revolving doors that made a faintly derisive whistling sound when you pushed them. It was two blocks to the parking lot. At the drugstore on the corner she said, \"Wait here for me. I forgot something. I won't be a minute.\" She was more than a minute. Walter Mitty lighted a cigarette. It began to rain, rain with sleet in it. He stood up against the wall of the drugstore, smoking. . . . He put his shoulders back and his heels together. \"To hell with the handkerchief,\" said Waker Mitty scornfully. He took one last drag on his cigarette and snapped it away. Then, with that faint, fleeting smile playing about his lips, he faced the firing squad; erect and motionless, proud and disdainful, Walter Mitty the Undefeated, inscrutable to the last. </p>\n",

This pleasure I have seldom enjoyed; for tho' I have been, if I may say it without vanity, an eminent author of almanacs annually now a full quarter of a century, my brother authors in the same way, for what reason I know not, have ever been very sparing in their applauses; and no other author has taken the least notice of me, so that did not my writings produce me some solid pudding, the great deficiency of praise would have quite discouraged me.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I concluded at length, that the people were the best judges of my merit; for they buy my works; and besides, in my rambles, where I am not personally known, I have frequently heard one or other of my adages repeated, with, as Poor Richard says, at the end on't; this gave me some satisfaction, as it showed not only that my instructions were regarded, but discovered likewise some respect for my authority; and I own, that to encourage the practice of remembering and repeating those wise sentences, I have sometimes quoted myself with great gravity. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Judge then how much I must have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate to you. I stopped my horse lately where a great number of people were collected at a vendue of merchant goods. The hour of sale not being come, they were conversing on the badness of the times, and one of the company called to a plain clean old man, with white locks, \"Pray, Father Abraham, what think you of the times? Won't these heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How shall we be ever able to pay them? What would you advise us to?\" Father Abraham stood up, and replied, \"If you'd have my advice, I'll give it you in short, for a word to the wise is enough, and many words won't fill a bushel, as Poor Richard says.\" They joined in desiring him to speak his mind, and gathering round him, he proceeded as follows: </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\"Friends, says he, and neighbors, the taxes are indeed very heavy, and if those laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more easily discharge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to some of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idleness, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly, and from these taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement. However let us hearken to good advice, and something may be done for us; God helps them that help themselves, as Poor Richard says, in his almanac of 1733. </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\"It would be thought a hard government that should tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its service. But idleness taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in idle employments or amusements, that amount to nothing. Sloth,by bringing on diseases, absolutely shortens life. Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labor wears, while the used key is always bright, as Poor Richard says. But dost thou love life, then do not squander time, for that's the stuff life is made of, as Poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep! forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave, as Poor Richard says. If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest prodigality, since, 1 as he elsewhere tells us, lost time is never found again, and what we call time-enough, always proves little enough: let us then be up and be doing, and doing to the purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity. Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry all easy, as Poor Richard says; and he that riseth late, must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake his business at night. While laziness travels so slowly, that poverty soon overtakes him, as we read in Poor Richard, who adds, drive thy business, let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>One summer, along about 1904, my father rented a camp on a lake in Maine and took us all there for the month of August. We all got ringworm from some kittens and had to rub Pond's Extract on our arms and legs night and morning, and my father rolled over in a canoe with all his clothes on; but outside of that the vacation was a success and from then on none of us ever thought there was any place in the world like that lake in Maine. We returned summer after summer--always on August 1st for one month. I have since become a salt-water man, but sometimes in summer there are days when the restlessness of the tides and the fearful cold of the sea water and the incessant wind which blows across the afternoon and into the evening make me wish for the placidity of a lake in the woods. A few weeks ago this feeling got so strong I bought myself a couple of bass hooks and a spinner and returned to the lake where we used to go, for a week's fishing and to revisit old haunts. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I took along my son, who had never had any fresh water up his nose and who had seen lily pads only from train windows. On the journey over to the lake I began to wonder what it would be like. I wondered how time would have marred this unique, this holy spot--the coves and streams, the hills that the sun set behind, the camps and the paths behind the camps. I was sure that the tarred road would have found it out and I wondered in what other ways it would be desolated. It is strange how much you can remember about places like that once you allow your mind to return into the grooves which lead back. You remember one thing, and that suddenly reminds you of another thing. I guess I remembered clearest of all the early mornings, when the lake was cool and motionless, remembered how the bedroom smelled of the lumber it was made of and of the wet woods whose scent entered through the screen. The partitions in the camp were thin and did not extend clear to the top of the rooms, and as I was always the first up I would dress softly so as not to wake the others, and sneak out into the sweet outdoors and start out in the canoe, keeping close along the shore in the long shadows of the pines. I remembered being very careful never to rub my paddle against the gunwale for fear of disturbing the stillness of the cathedral.  </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The lake had never been what you would call a wild lake. There were cottages sprinkled around the shores, and it was in farming although the shores of the lake were quite heavily wooded. Some of the cottages were owned by nearby farmers, and 2 you would live at the shore and eat your meals at the farmhouse. That's what our family did. But although it wasn't wild, it was a fairly large and undisturbed lake and there were places in it which, to a child at least, seemed infinitely remote and primeval. </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I was right about the tar: it led to within half a mile of the shore But when I got back there, with my boy, and we settled into a camp near a farmhouse and into the kind of summertime I had known, I could tell that it was going to be pretty much the same as it had been before--I knew it, lying in bed the first morning, smelling the bedroom, and hearing the boy sneak quietly out and go off along the shore in a boat. I began to sustain the illusion that he was I, and therefore, by simple transposition, that I was my father. This sensation persisted, kept cropping up all the time we were there. It was not an entirely new feeling, but in this setting it grew much stronger. I seemed to be living a dual existence. I would be in the middle of some simple act, I would be picking up a bait box or laying down a table fork, or I would be saying something, and suddenly it would be not I but my father who was saying the words or making the gesture. It gave me a creepy sensation. </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We went fishing the first morning. I felt the same damp moss covering the worms in the bait can, and saw the dragonfly alight on the tip of my rod as it hovered a few inches from the surface of the water. It was the arrival of this fly that convinced me beyond any doubt that everything was as it always had been, that the years were a mirage and there had been no years. The small waves were the same, chucking the rowboat under the chin as we fished at anchor, and the boat was the same boat, the same color green and the ribs broken in the same places, and under the floor-boards the same freshwater leavings and debris--the dead helgramite, the wisps of moss, the rusty discarded fishhook, the dried blood from yesterday's catch. We stared silently at the tips of our rods, at the dragonflies that came and wells. I lowered the tip of mine into the water, tentatively, pensively dislodging the fly, which darted two feet away, poised, darted two feet back, and came to rest again a little farther up the rod. There had been no years between the ducking of this dragonfly and the other one--the one that was part of memory. I looked at the boy, who was silently watching his fly, and it was my hands that held his rod, my eyes watching. I felt dizzy and didn't know which rod I was at the end of.</p>\n",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When I saw England for the first time, I was a child in school sitting at a desk. The England I was looking at was laid out on a map gently, beautifully, delicately, a very special jewel: it lay on a bed of sky blue\u2014the background of the map\u2014its yellow form mysterious, because though it looked like a leg of mutton, it could not really look like anything so familiar as a leg of mutton because it was England\u2014 with shadings of pink and green, unlike any shadings of pink and green I had seen before, squiggly veins of red running in every direction. England was a special jewel all right, and only special people got to wear it. The people who got to wear England were English people. They wore it well and they wore it everywhere: in jungles, in deserts, on plains, on top of the highest mountains, on all oceans, on all seas, in places where they were not welcomed, in places they should not have been. When my teacher had pinned this map up on the blackboard, she said, \u201cThis is England\u201d\u2014 and she said it with authority, seriousness, and adoration, and we all sat up. It was as if she had said, \u201cThis is Jerusalem, the place you will go to when you die but only if you have been good.\u201d We understood then\u2014we were meant to understand then\u2014that England was to be our source of myth and the source from which we got our sense of reality, our sense of what was meaningful, our sense of what was meaningless \u2014about much about our own lives and much about the very idea of us headed that last list. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>At the time I was a child sitting at my desk seeing England for the first time, I was already familiar with the greatness of it. Each morning before I left for school, I ate a breakfast of half a grapefruit, an egg, bread and butter, and a slice of cheese, and a cup of cocoa; or half a grapefruit, a bowl of oat porridge, bread and butter and a slice of cheese, and a cup of cocoa. The can of cocoa was often left on the table in front of me. It had written on it the name of the company, the year the company was established, and the words \u201cMade in England.\u201d Those words \u201cMade in England,\u201d were written on the box the oats came in too. They would also have been written on the box the shoes I was wearing came in; a bolt of gray linen cloth lying on the shelf of the store which my mother had bought three yards to make the uniform that I was wearing had written along its edge those three words. The shoes I wore were made in England; so were my socks and cotton undergarments and the satin ribbons I wore tied at the end of two plaits of my hair. My father, who might have sat next to me at breakfast, was a carpenter and a cabinet maker. The shoes he wore to work would have been made in England, as were his khaki shirt and trousers, his underpants and undershirt, his socks and brown felt hat. Felt was not the proper material, from which a hat that was expected to provide shade from the hot sun should be made, but my father must have seen and admired a picture of an Englishmen wearing such a hat in England, and this picture that he saw must have been so compelling that it caused him to wear the wrong hat for a hot climate most of his long life. And this hat\u2014a brown felt hat\u2014became so central to his character that it was the first thing he put on in the morning as he stepped out of bed and the last thing he took off before he stepped back into bed at night. As we sat at breakfast a car might go by. The car, a Hillman or a Zephyr, was made in England. The very idea of the meal itself, breakfast, and its substantial quality and quantity was an idea from England; we somehow knew that in England they began the day with this meal called breakfast and a proper breakfast was a big breakfast. No one I knew liked eating so much food so early in the day; it made us feel sleepy, tired. But this breakfast business was Made in England like almost everything else that surrounded us, the exceptions being the sea, the sky, and the air we breathed.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You should know that my mother's expressive command of English belies how much she actually understands. She reads the Forbes report, listens to Wall Street Week, converses daily with her stockbroker, reads all of Shirley MacLaine's books with ease--all kinds of things I can't begin to understand. Yet some of my friends tell me they understand 50 percent of what my mother says. Some say they understand 80 to 90 percent. Some say they understand none of it, as if she were speaking pure Chinese. But to me, my mother's English is perfectly clear, perfectly natural. It's my mother tongue. Her language, as I hear it, is vivid, direct, full of observation and imagery. That was the language that helped shape the way I saw things, expressed things, made sense of the world. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Lately, I've been giving more thought to the kind of English my mother speaks. Like others, I have described it to people as 'broken\" or \"fractured\" English. But I wince when I say that. It has always bothered me that I can think of no way to describe it other than \"broken,\" as if it were damaged and needed to be fixed, as if it lacked a certain wholeness and soundness. I've heard other terms used, \"limited English,\" for example. But they seem just as bad, as if everything is limited, including people's perceptions of the limited English speaker. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I know this for a fact, because when I was growing up, my mother's \"limited\" English limited my perception of her. I was ashamed of her English. I believed that her English reflected the quality of what she had to say That is, because she expressed them imperfectly her thoughts were imperfect. And I had plenty of empirical evidence to support me: the fact that people in department stores, at banks, and at restaurants did not take her seriously, did not give her good service, pretended not to understand her, or even acted as if they did not hear her. </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>My mother has long realized the limitations of her English as well. When I was fifteen, she used to have me call people on the phone to pretend I was she. In this guise, I was forced to ask for information or even to complain and yell at people who had been rude to her. One time it was a call to her stockbroker in New York. She had cashed out her small portfolio and it just so happened we were going to go to New York the next week, our very first trip outside California. I had to get on the phone and say in an adolescent voice that was not very convincing, \"This is Mrs. Tan.\" </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And my mother was standing in the back whispering loudly, \"Why he don't send me check, already two weeks late. So mad he lie to me, losing me money. </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And then I said in perfect English, \"Yes, I'm getting rather concerned. You had agreed to send the check two weeks ago, but it hasn't arrived.\" </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Then she began to talk more loudly. \"What he want, I come to New York tell him front of his boss, you cheating me?\" And I was trying to calm her down, make her be quiet, while telling the stockbroker, \"I can't tolerate any more excuses. If I don't receive the check immediately, I am going to have to speak to your manager when I'm in New York next week.\" And sure enough, the following week there we were in front of this astonished stockbroker, and I was sitting there red-faced and quiet, and my mother, the real Mrs. Tan, was shouting at his boss in her impeccable broken English.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The village\u2019s only real attraction, which explains the tourist season, is the hot spring water. A disquietingly high proportion of these tourists are cripples, or semicripples, who come year after year\u2014from other parts of Switzerland, usually\u2014to take the waters. This lends the village, at the height of the season, a rather terrifying air of sanctity, as though it were a lesser Lourdes. There is often something beautiful, there is always something awful, in the spectacle of a person who has lost one of his faculties, a faculty he never questioned until it was gone, and who struggles to recover it. Yet people remain people, on crutches or indeed on deathbeds; and wherever I passed, the first summer I was here, among the native villagers or among the lame, a wind passed with me\u2014 of astonishment, curiosity, amusement, and outrage. That first summer I stayed two weeks and never intended to return. But I did return in the winter, to work; the village offers, obviously, no distractions whatever and has the further advantage of being extremely cheap. Now it is winter again, a year later, and I am here again. Everyone in the village knows my name, though they scarcely ever use it, knows that I come from America\u2014though, this, apparently, they will never really believe: black men come from Africa\u2014and everyone knows that I am the friend of the son of a woman who was born here, and that I am staying in their chalet. But I remain as much a stranger today as I was the first day I arrived, and the children shout Neger! Neger! as I walk along the streets. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It must be admitted that in the beginning I was far too shocked to have any real reaction. In so far as I reacted at all, I reacted by trying to be pleasant\u2014it being a great part of the American Negro\u2019s education (long before he goes to school) that he must make people \u201clike\u201d him. This smile-and-the-world-smiles-with-you routine worked about as well in this situation as it had in the situation for which it was designed,which is to say that it did not work at all. No one, after all, can be liked whose human weight and complexity cannot be, or has not been, admitted. My smile was simply another unheard-of phenomenon which allowed them to see my teeth\u2014they did not, really, see my smile and I began to think that, should I take to snarling, no one would notice any difference. All of the physical characteristics of the Negro which had caused me, in America, a very different and almost forgotten pain were nothing less than miraculous\u2014or infernal\u2014in the eyes of the village people. Some thought my hair was the color of tar, that it had the texture of wire, or the texture of cotton. It was jocularly suggested that I might let it all grow long and make myself a winter coat. If I sat in the sun for more than five minutes some daring creature was certain to come along and gingerly put his fingers on my hair, as though he were afraid of an electric shock, or put his hand on my hand, astonished that the color did not rub off. In all of this, in which it must be conceded there was the charm of genuine wonder and in which there was certainly no element of intentional unkindness, there was yet no suggestion that I was human: I was simply a living wonder.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is surprising to some of my professional friends that some people, including those who should know better, still put others \"in their place\u201d Though rarer, these incidents are still common\u00adplace in my life. It happened to me most recently during a stay at a very classy metropolitan hotel favored by young profes\u00adsional couples for their weddings. Late one evening after the theater, as I walked toward my room with my new colleague (a woman with whom I was coordinating an arts program), a middle-aged man in a tuxedo, a young girl in satin and lace on his arm, stepped directly into our path. With his champagne glass extended toward me, he exclaimed, \"Evita!\" </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Our way blocked, my companion and I listened as the man half-recited, half-bellowed \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina.\" When he finished, the young girl said: \"How about a round of applause for my daddy?\" We complied, hoping this would bring the silly spectacle to a close. I was becoming aware that our little group I was attracting the attention of the other guests. \"Daddy\" must have perceived this too, and he once more barred the way as we tried to walk past him. He began to shout-sing a ditty to the tune of \"La Bamba\"&mdash;except the lyrics were about a girl named Maria whose exploits all rhymed with her name and gonorrhea. The girl kept saying \"Oh, Daddy\" and looking at me with pleading eyes. She wanted me to laugh along with the others. My companion and I stood silently waiting for the man to end his offensive song. When he finished, I looked not at him but at his daughter. I advised her calmly never to ask her father what he had done in the army. Then I walked between them and to my room. My friend complimented me on my cool handling of the situation. I confessed to her that I really had wanted to push the jerk into the swimming pool. I knew this same man&mdash;probably a corporate executive, well educated, even worldly by most standards&mdash;would not have been likely to regale a white woman with a dirty song in public. He would perhaps have checked his impulse by assuming that she could be somebody's wife or mother, or at least somebody who might take offense. But to him, I was just an Evita or a Maria: merely a character in his cartoon-populated universe. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Because of my education and my proficiency with the English language, I have acquired many mechanisms for dealing with the anger l experience. This was not true for my parents, nor is it true for the many Latin women working at menial jobs who must put up with stereotypes about our ethnic group such as: \"They make good domestics.\" This is another facet of the myth of the Latin woman in the United States. Its origin is simple to deduce. Work as domestics, waitressing, and factory jobs are all that's available to women with little English and few skills. The myth of the Hispanic menial has been sustained by the same media phenom\u00adenon that made \"Mammy\" from Gone with the Wind America's idea of the black woman for generations; Maria, the housemaid or counter girl, is now indelibly etched into the national psyche. The big and the little screens have presented us with the picture of the funny Hispanic maid, mispronouncing words and cooking up a spicy storm in a shiny California kitchen.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This media-engendered image of the Latina in the United States has been documented by feminist Hispanic scholars, who claim that such portrayals are partially responsible for the denial of op\u00adportunities for upward mobility among Latinas in the professions. I have a Chicana friend working on a Ph.D. in philosophy at a ma\u00adjor university. She says her doctor still shakes his head in puzzled amazement at all the \"big words\" she uses. Since l do not wear my diplomas around my neck for all to see, I too have on occasion been sent to that \"kitchen,\" where some think I obviously belong.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But at that moment I glanced round at the crowd that had followed me.It was an immense crowd, two thousand at the least and growing every minute. It blocked the road for a long distance on either side. I looked at the sea of yellow faces above the garish clothes\u2014faces all happy and excited over this bit of fun, all certain that the elephant was going to be shot. They were watching me as they would watch a conjurer about to perform a trick. They did not like me, but with the magical rifle in my hand I was momentarily worth watching. And suddenly I realized that I would have to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me and I had got to do it; I could feel their two thousand wills pressing me forward irresistibly. And it was at this moment, as I stood there with the rifle in my hands, that I first grasped the hollowness, the futility of the white man\u2019s dominion in the East. Here was I, the white man with his gun, standing in front of the unarmed crowd\u2014seemingly the leading actor of the piece; but in reality I was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind. I perceived in this moment that when the white man turns tyrant it is his own freedom that he destroys. He becomes a sort of hollow, posing dummy, the conventionalized figure of a sahib. For it is the condition of his rule that he shall spend his life in trying to \u201cimpress the natives,\u201d and so in every crisis he has got to do what the \u201cnatives\u201d expect of him. He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it. I had got to shoot the elephant. I had committed myself to doing it when I sent for the rifle. A sahib has got to act like a sahib; he has got to appear resolute, to know his own mind and do definite things. To come all that way, rifle in hand, with two thousand people marching at my heels, and then to trail feebly away, having done nothing\u2014no, that was impossible. The crowd would laugh at me. And my whole life, every white man\u2019s in the East, was one long struggle not to be laughed at.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But I did not want to shoot the elephant. I watched him beating his bunch of grass against his knees, with that preoccupied grandmotherly air that elephants have. It seemed to me that it would be murder to shoot him. At that age I was not squeamish about killing animals, but I had never shot an elephant and never wanted to. (Somehow it always seems worse to kill a large animal.) Besides, there was the beast\u2019s owner to be considered. Alive, the elephant was worth at least a hundred pounds; dead, he would only be worth the value of his tusks, five pounds, possibly. But I had got to act quickly. I turned to the experienced-looking Burmans who had been there when we arrived, and asked them how the elephant had been behaving. They all said the same thing; he took no notice of you if you left him alone, but he might charge if you went too close to him.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was perfectly clear to me what I ought to do. I ought to walk up to within, say, twenty-five yards of the elephant and test his behavior. If he charged I could shoot; if he took no notice of me, it would be safe to leave him until the mahout came back. But I also knew that I was going to do no such thing. I was a poor shot with a rifle and the ground was soft mud into which one would sink at every step. If the elephant charged and I missed him, I should have about as much chance as a toad under a steam roller. But even then I was not thinking particularly of my own skin, only of the watchful yellow faces behind. For at that moment, with the crowd watching me, I was not afraid in the ordinary sense, as I would have been if I had been alone. A white man mustn\u2019t be frightened in front of \u201cnatives\u201d; and so, in general, he isn\u2019t frightened. The thought in my mind was that if anything went wrong those two thousand Burmans would see me pursued, caught, trampled on, and reduced to a grinning corpse like that Indian up the hill. And if that happened it was quite probable that some of them would laugh. That would never do.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There was only one alternative. I shoved the cartridges into the magazine and lay down on the road to get a better aim. The crowd grew very still, and a deep, low, happy sigh, as of people who see the theater curtain go up at last, breathed from innumerable throats. They were going to have their bit of fun after all. The rifle was a beautiful German thing with cross-hair sights. I did not know then that in shooting an elephant one would shoot to cut an imaginary bar running from earhole to earhole. I ought, therefore, as the elephant was sideways on, to have aimed straight at his earhole; actually I aimed several inches in front of this, thinking the brain would be further forward.</p>\n",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For practical purposes, everyone knows what a lobster is. As usual, though, there\u2019s much more to know than most of us care about \u2014 it\u2019s all a matter of what your interests are. Taxonomically speaking, a lobster is a marine crustacean of the family Homaridae, characterized by five pairs of jointed legs, the first pair terminating in large pincerish claws used for subduing prey. Like many other species of benthic carnivore, lobsters are both hunters and scavengers. They have stalked eyes, gills on their legs, and antennae. There are a dozen or so different kinds worldwide, of which the relevant species here is the Maine lobster, Homarus americanus.\u200b The name \u201clobster\u201d comes from the Old English loppestre,\u200b which is thought to be a corrupt form of the Latin word for locust combined with the Old English loppe\u200b, which means spider. [\u2026] The point is that lobsters are basically giant sea insects. Like most arthropods, they date from the Jurassic period, biologically so much older than mammalia that they might as well be from 1 of 6 another planet.  </p><p>[\u2026] </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But they are themselves good eating. Or so we think now. Up until sometime in the 1800s, though, lobster was literally low-class food, eaten only by the poor and institutionalized. Even in the harsh penal environment of early America, some colonies had laws against feeding lobsters to inmates more than once a week because it was thought to be cruel and unusual, like making people eat rats. [\u2026] Now, of course, lobster is posh, a delicacy, only a step or two down from caviar. </p> <p>[\u2026] </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As an a la carte entree, lobster can be baked, broiled, steamed, grilled, saut\u00e9ed, stir-fried, or microwaved. The most common method, though, is boiling. If you\u2019re someone who enjoys having lobster at home, this is probably the way you do it, since boiling is so easy. You need a large kettle w/ cover, which you fill about half full with water (the standard advice is that you want 2.5 quarts of water per lobster). Seawater is optimal, or you can add two tbsp salt per quart from the tap. It also helps to know how much your lobsters weigh. You get the water boiling, put in the lobsters one at a time, cover the kettle, and bring it back up to a boil. Then you bank the heat and let the kettle simmer \u2014 ten minutes for the first pound of lobster, then three minutes for each pound after that. (This is assuming you\u2019ve got hard-shell lobsters, which, again, if you don\u2019t live between Boston and Halifax is probably what you\u2019ve got. For shedders, you\u2019re supposed to subtract three minutes from the total.) The reason the kettle\u2019s lobsters turn scarlet is that boiling somehow suppresses every pigment in their chitin but one. If you want an easy test of whether the lobsters are done, you try pulling on one of their antennae \u2014 if it comes out of the head with minimal effort, you\u2019re ready to eat. </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A detail so obvious that most recipes don\u2019t even bother to mention it is that each lobster is supposed to be alive when you put it in the kettle. This is part of the lobster\u2019s modern appeal \u2014 it\u2019s the freshest food there is. [\u2026] So then here is a question that\u2019s all but unavoidable at the World\u2019s Largest Lobster Cooker, and may arise in kitchens across the US: Is it all right to boil a sentient creature alive just for our gustatory pleasure? A related set of concerns: Is the previous question irksomely PC or sentimental? What does \u201call right\u201d even mean in this context? Is the whole thing just a matter of personal choice?  </p><p>[\u2026] </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Before we go any further, let\u2019s acknowledge that the questions of whether and how different kinds of animals feel pain, and of whether and why it might be justifiable to inflict pain on them in order to eat them, turn out to be extremely complex and difficult. And comparative neuroanatomy is only part of the problem. Since pain is a totally subjective mental experience, we do not have direct access to anyone or anything\u2019s pain but our own; and even just the principles by which we can infer that other human beings experience pain and have a legitimate interest in not feeling pain involve hard-core philosophy \u2014 metaphysics, epistemology, value theory, ethics. The fact that even the most highly evolved nonhuman mammals can\u2019t use language to communicate with us about their subjective mental experience is only the first layer or additional complication in trying to extend our reasoning about pain and morality to animals. And everything gets progressively more abstract and convulsed as we move farther and farther out from the higher-type mammals into cattle and swine and dogs and cats and rodents, and then birds and fish, and finally invertebrates like lobsters.</p>",

She packed slices of brown bread and butter and green pepper and carrot sticks. There were little violently yellow iced cakes with scalloped edges called \u201cmarigolds,\u201d that came from Cushman's Bakery. There was a spice bun and rock-cakes from Newtons, the West Indian bakery across Lenox Avenue from St. Mark\u2019s School, and iced tea in a wrapped mayonnaise jar. There were sweet pickles for us and dill pickles for my father, and peaches with the fuzz still on them, individually wrapped to keep them from bruising. And, for neatness, there were piles of napkins and a little tin box with a washcloth dampened with rosewater and glycerine for wiping sticky mouths. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I wanted to eat in the dining car because I had read all about them, but my mother reminded me for the umpteenth time that dining car food always cost too much money and besides, you never could tell whose hands had been playing all over that food, nor where those same hands had been just before. My mother never mentioned that black people were not allowed into railroad dining cars headed south in 1947. As usual, whatever my mother did not like and could not change, she ignored. Perhaps it would go away, deprived of her attention. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I learned later that Phyllis's high school senior class trip had been to Washington, but the nuns had given her back her deposit in private, explaining to her that the class, all of whom were white, except Phyllis, would be staying in a hotel where Phyllis \u201cwould not be happy,\u201d meaning, Daddy explained to her, also in private, that they did not rent rooms to Negroes. \u201cWe will take you to Washington, ourselves,\u201d my father had avowed, \u201cand not just for an overnight in some measly fleabag hotel.\u201d </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>American racism was a new and crushing reality that my parents had to deal with every day of their lives once they came to this country. They handled it as a private woe. My mother and father believed that they could best protect their children from the realities of race in America and the fact of American racism by never giving them name, much less discussing their nature. We were told we must never trust white people, but why was never explained, nor the nature of their ill will. Like so many other vital pieces of information in my childhood, I was supposed to know without being told. It always seemed like a very strange injunction coming from my mother, who looked so much like one of those people we were never supposed to trust. But something always warned me not to ask my mother why she wasn't white, and why Auntie Lillah and Auntie Etta weren't, even though they were all that same problematic color so different from my father and me, even from my sisters, who were somewhere in-between. </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In Washington, D.C., we had one large room with two double beds and an extra cot for me. It was a back-street hotel that belonged to a friend of my father's who was in real estate, and I spent the whole next day after Mass squinting up at the Lincoln Memorial where Marian Anderson had sung after the D.A.R. refused to allow her to sing in their auditorium because she was black. Or because she was \u201cColored,\" my father said as he told us the story. Except that what he probably said was \u201cNegro,\" because for his times, my father was quite progressive. </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I was squinting because I was in that silent agony that characterized all of my childhood summers, from the time school let out in June to the end of July, brought about by my dilated and vulnerable eyes exposed to the summer brightness. </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I viewed Julys through an agonizing corolla of dazzling whiteness and I always hated the Fourth of July, even before I came to realize the travesty such a celebration was for black people in this country. </p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>My parents did not approve of sunglasses, nor of their expense.</p>",

Bowman, having nearly been sent to a deep-space death by the malfunctioning machine, is calmly, coldly disconnecting the memory circuits that control its artificial brain. \u201cDave, my mind is going,\u201d HAL says, forlornly. \u201cI can feel it. I can feel it.\u201d </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I can feel it, too. Over the past few years I\u2019ve had an uncomfortable sense that  someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory. My mind isn\u2019t going \u2014 so far as I can tell \u2014 but it\u2019s changing. I\u2019m not thinking the way I used to think. I can feel it most strongly when I\u2019m reading. Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy. My mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument, and I\u2019d spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose. That\u2019s rarely the case anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else to do. I feel as if I\u2019m always dragging my wayward brain back to the text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I think I know what\u2019s going on. For more than a decade now, I\u2019ve been spending a lot  of time online, searching and surfing and sometimes adding to the great databases of the Internet. The Web has been a godsend to me as a writer. Research that once required days in the stacks or periodical rooms of libraries can now be done in minutes. A few Google searches, some quick clicks on hyperlinks, and I\u2019ve got the telltale fact or pithy quote I was after. Even when I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m as likely as not to be foraging in the Web\u2019s info-thickets\u2014reading and writing e-mails, scanning headlines and blog posts, watching videos and listening to podcasts, or just tripping from link to link to link (Unlike footnotes, to which they\u2019re sometimes likened, hyperlinks don\u2019t merely point to related works; they propel you toward them.)</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For me, as for others, the Net is becoming a universal medium, the conduit for most of the information that flows through my eyes and ears and into my mind. The advantages of having immediate access to such an incredibly rich store of information are many, and they\u2019ve been widely described and duly applauded. \u201cThe perfect recall of silicon memory,\u201d Wired\u2019s Clive Thompson has written, \u201ccan be an enormous boon to thinking.\u201d But that boon comes at a price. As the media theorist Marshall McLuhan pointed out in the 1960s, media are not just passive channels of information. They supply the stuff of thought, but they also shape the process of thought. And what the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to take in information the way the Net distributes it: in a swiftly moving stream of particles. Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski. </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Anecdotes alone don\u2019t prove much. And we still await the long-term neurological and psychological experiments that will provide a definitive picture of how Internet use affects cognition. But a recently published study of online research habits, conducted by scholars from University College London, suggests that we may well be in the midst of a sea change in the way we read and think. As part of the five-year research program, the scholars examined computer logs documenting the behavior of visitors to two popular research sites, one operated by the British Library and one by a U.K. educational consortium, that provide access to journal articles, e-books, and other sources of written information. They found that people using the sites exhibited \u201ca form of skimming activity,\u201d hopping from one source to another and rarely returning to any source they\u2019d already visited. They typically read no more than one or two pages of an article or book before they would \u201cbounce\u201d out to another site. Sometimes they\u2019d save a long article, but there\u2019s no evidence that they ever went back and actually read it. The authors of the study report:</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of \u201creading\u201d are emerging as users \u201cpower browse\u201d horizontally through titles, contents pages, and abstracts going for quick wins.

My school is an easy ten-minute walk from my apartment, and on the first day of class I arrived early, watching as the returning students greeted one another in the school lobby. Vacations were recounted, and questions were raised concerning mutual friends with names like Kang and Vlatnya. Regardless of their nationalities, everyone spoke what sounded to me like excellent French. Some accents were better than others, but the students exhibited an ease and confidence that I found intimidating. As an added discomfort, they were all young, attractive, and well-dressed, causing me to feel not unlike Pa Kettle trapped backstage after a fashion show. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The first day of class was nerve-racking because I knew I\u2019d be expected to perform. That\u2019s the way they do it here \u2013 it\u2019s everybody into the language pool, sink or swim. The teacher marched in, deeply tanned from a recent vacation, and proceeded to rattle off a series of administrative announcements. I\u2019ve spent quite a few summers in Normandy, and I took a monthlong French class before leaving New York. I\u2019m not completely in the dark, yet I understood only half of what this woman was saying. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cIf you have not <em>meimslsxp</em> or <em>lgpdmurct</em> by this time, then you should not be in this room. Has everyone <em>apzkiubjxow</em>? Everyone? Good, we shall begin.\u201d She spread out her lesson plan and sighed, saying, \u201cAll right, then, who knows the alphabet?\u201d </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was startling because (a) I hadn\u2019t been asked that question in a while and (b) I realized, while laughing, that I myself did not know the alphabet. They\u2019re the same letters, but in France they\u2019re pronounced differently. I know the shape of the alphabet but had no idea what it actually sounded like. </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201c<em>Ahh</em>.\u201d The teacher went to the board and sketched the letter a. \u201cDo we have anyone in the room whose first name commences with an <em>ahh</em>?\u201d </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Two Polish Annas raised their hands, and the teachers instructed them to present themselves by stating their names, nationalities, occupations, and a brief list of things they liked and disliked in this world. The first Anna hailed from an industrial town outside of Warsaw and had front teeth the size of tombstones. She worked as a seamstress, enjoyed quiet times with friends, and hated the mosquito. </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cOh, really,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cHow very interesting. I thought that everyone loved the mosquito, but here, in front of all the world, you claim to detest him. How is it that we\u2019ve been blessed with someone as unique and original as you? Tell us, please.\u201d </p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The seamstress did not understand what was being said but knew that this was an occasion for shame. Her rabbity mouth huffed for breath, and she stared down at her lap as though the appropriate comeback were stitched somewhere alongside the zipper of her slacks. </p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The second Anna learned from the first and claimed to love sunshine and detest lies. It sounded like a translation of one of those Playmate of the Month data sheets, the answers always written in the same loopy handwriting: \u201cTurn-ons: Mom\u2019s famous fivealarm chili! Turn offs: insecurity and guys who come on too strong!!!!\u201d </p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The two Polish Annas surely had clear notions of what they loved and hated, but like the rest of us, they were limited in terms of vocabulary, and this made them appear less than sophisticated. The teacher forged on, and we learned that Carlos, the Argentine bandonion player, loved wine, music, and, in his words, \u201cmaking sex with the womans of the world.\u201d Next came a beautiful young Yugoslav who identified herself as an optimist, saying that she loved everything that life had to offer. </p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The teacher licked her lips, revealing a hint of the saucebox we would later come to know. She crouched low for her attack, placed her hands on the young woman\u2019s desk, and leaned close, saying, \u201cOh yeah? And do you love your little war?\u201d </p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>While the optimist struggled to defend herself, I scrambled to think of an answer to what had obviously become a trick question. How often is one asked what he loves in this world? More to the point, how often is one asked and then publicly ridiculed for his answer? I recalled my mother, flushed with wine, pounding the table top one night, saying, \u201cLove? I love a good steak cooked rare. I love my cat, and I love \u2026\u201d My sisters and I leaned forward, waiting to hear out names. \u201cTums,\u201d our mother said. \u201cI love Tums.\u201d</p>\n",

        "author": "Peter Singer",
        "type": "Essay",
        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In his 1996 book, ''Living High and Letting Die,'' the New York University philosopher Peter Unger presented an ingenious series of imaginary examples designed to probe our intuitions about whether it is wrong to live well without giving substantial amounts of money to help people who are hungry, malnourished or dying from easily treatable illnesses like diarrhea. Here's my paraphrase of one of these examples: </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Bob is close to retirement. He has invested most of his savings in a very rare and valuable old car, a Bugatti, which he has not been able to insure. The Bugatti is his pride and joy. In addition to the pleasure he gets from driving and caring for his car, Bob knows that its rising market value means that he will always be able to sell it and live comfortably after retirement. One day when Bob is out for a drive, he parks the Bugatti near the end of a railway siding and goes for a walk up the track. As he does so, he sees that a runaway train, with no one aboard, is running down the railway track. Looking farther down the track, he sees the small figure of a child very likely to be killed by the runaway train. He can't stop the train and the child is too far away to warn of the danger, but he can throw a switch that will divert the train down the siding where his Bugatti is parked. Then nobody will be killed -- but the train will destroy his Bugatti. Thinking of his joy in owning the car and the financial security it represents, Bob decides not to throw the switch. The child is killed. For many years to come, Bob enjoys owning his Bugatti and the financial security it represents. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Bob's conduct, most of us will immediately respond, was gravely wrong. Unger agrees. But then he reminds us that we, too, have opportunities to save the lives of children. We can give to organizations like Unicef or Oxfam America. How much would we have to give one of these organizations to have a high probability of saving the life of a child threatened by easily preventable diseases? (I do not believe that children are more worth saving than adults, but since no one can argue that children have brought their poverty on themselves, focusing on them simplifies the issues.) Unger called up some experts and used the information they provided to offer some plausible estimates that include the cost of raising money, administrative expenses and the cost of delivering aid where it is most needed. By his calculation, $200 in donations would help a sickly 2-yearold transform into a healthy 6-year-old -- offering safe passage through childhood's most dangerous years. To show how practical philosophical argument can be, Unger even tells his readers that they can easily donate funds by using their credit card and calling one of these toll-free numbers: (800) 367-5437 for Unicef; (800) 693-2687 for Oxfam America.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Now you, too, have the information you need to save a child's life. How should you judge yourself if you don't do it? Think again about Bob and his Bugatti. Unlike Dora, Bob did not have to look into the eyes of the child he was sacrificing for his own material comfort. The child was a complete stranger to him and too far away to relate to in an intimate, personal way. Unlike Dora, too, he did not mislead the child or initiate the chain of events imperiling him. In all these respects, Bob's situation resembles that of people able but unwilling to donate to overseas aid and differs from Dora's situation. </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If you still think that it was very wrong of Bob not to throw the switch that would have diverted the train and saved the child's life, then it is hard to see how you could deny that it is also very wrong not to send money to one of the organizations listed above. Unless, that is, there is some morally important difference between the two situations that I have overlooked. </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Is it the practical uncertainties about whether aid will really reach the people who need it? Nobody who knows the world of overseas aid can doubt that such uncertainties exist. But Unger's figure of $200 to save a child's life was reached after he had made conservative assumptions about the proportion of the money donated that will actually reach its target. </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>One genuine difference between Bob and those who can afford to donate to overseas aid organizations but don't is that only Bob can save the child on the tracks, whereas there are hundreds of millions of people who can give $200 to overseas aid organizations. The problem is that most of them aren't doing it. Does this mean that it is all right for you not to do it? </p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Suppose that there were more owners of priceless vintage cars -- Carol, Dave, Emma, Fred and so on, down to Ziggy -- all in exactly the same situation as Bob, with their own siding and their own switch, all sacrificing the child in order to preserve their own cherished car. Would that make it all right for Bob to do the same? To answer this question affirmatively is to endorse follow-the-crowd ethics -- the kind of ethics that led many Germans to look away when the Nazi atrocities were being committed. We do not excuse them because others were behaving no better. </p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We seem to lack a sound basis for drawing a clear moral line between Bob's situation and that of any reader of this article with $200 to spare who does not donate it to an overseas aid agency. These readers seem to be acting at least as badly as Bob was acting when he chose to let the runaway train hurtle toward the unsuspecting child. In the light of this conclusion, I trust that many readers will reach for the phone and donate that $200. Perhaps you should do it before reading further. </p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Now that you have distinguished yourself morally from people who put their vintage cars ahead of a child's life, how about treating yourself and your partner to dinner at your favorite restaurant? But wait. The money you will spend at the restaurant could also help save the lives of children overseas! True, you weren't planning to blow $200 tonight, but if you were to give up dining out just for one month, you would easily save that amount. And what is one month's dining out, compared to a child's life? There's the rub. Since there are a lot of desperately needy children in the world, there will always be another child whose life you could save for another $200. Are you therefore obliged to keep giving until you have nothing left? At what point can you stop?</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>At first, the new scavenger is filled with disgust and self-loathing. He is ashamed of being seen and may lurk around, trying to duck behind things, or he may try to dive at night\u2026 Every grain of rice seems to be a maggot. Everything seems to stink. He can wipe the egg yolk off the found can, but he cannot erase the stigma of eating garbage out of his mind.  </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That stage passes with experience. The scavenger finds a pair of running shoes that fit, look, and smell brand new. He finds a pocket calculator in perfect working order. He finds pristine ice cream, still frozen, more than he can eat or keep. He begins to understand: people do throw away perfectly good stuff, a lot of perfectly good stuff. At this stage, Dumpster shyness begins to dissipate. The diver, after all, has the last laugh. He is finding all manner of good things, which are his for the taking. Those who disparage his profession are the fools, not he.   </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>He may begin to hang onto some perfectly good things for which he has neither a use nor a market. Then he begins to take note of the things which are not perfectly good but are nearly so. He mates a Walkman with broken earphones and one that is missing a battery cover. He picks up things, which he can repair. At this stage, he may become lost and never recover. Dumpsters are full of things of some potential value to someone and of things, which never have intrinsic value but are interesting. All the Dumpster divers I have known come to the point of trying to acquire everything they touch. Why not take it, they reason, since it is all free. This is, of course, hopeless. Most divers come to realize that they must restrict themselves to items of relatively immediate utility. But in some cases the diver simply cannot control himself. I have met several of these packrat types. Their ideas of the values of various pieces of junk verge on the psychotic. Every bit of glass may be a diamond, they think, and all that glistens, gold\u2026   </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Occasionally a find tells a story. Dumpster things are often sad\u2014abandoned teddy bears, shredded wedding books, despaired-of sales kits. I find many pets lying in state in Dumpsters. Although I hope to get off the streets so that Lizbeth can have a long and comfortable old age, I know this hope is not very realistic. So I suppose when her time comes she too will go into a Dumpster. I will have no better place for her...    </p><p>[...]</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I find diaries and journals. I have often thought of compiling a book of literary found objects. And perhaps I will one day. But what I find is hopelessly commonplace and bad without being, even unconsciously, camp. College students also discard their papers. I am horrified to discover the kind of paper which now merits an \u201cA\u201d in an undergraduate course. I am grateful, however, for the number of good books and magazines the students throw out\u2026   </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dumpster diving is outdoor work, often surprisingly pleasant. It is not entirely predictable; things of interest turn up every day and some say there are finds of great value. I am always very pleased when I can turn up exactly the thing I most wanted to find. Yet in spite of the element of chance, scavenging more than most other pursuits tends to yield returns in some proportion to the effort and intelligence brought to bear. It is very sweet to turn up a few dollars in change from a Dumpster that has just been gone over by a wino.  </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The land is now covered with cities. The cities are full of Dumpsters. I think of scavenging as a modern form of self-reliance. In any event, after ten years of government service, where everything is geared to the lowest common denominator, I find work that rewards initiative and effort refreshing. Certainly, I would be happy to have a sinecure again, but I am not heartbroken not to have one anymore.  </p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I find from the experience of scavenging two rather deep lessons. The first is to take what I can use and let the rest go by. I have come to think that there is no value in the abstract. A thing I cannot use or make useful, perhaps by trading, has no value however fine or rare it may be. I mean useful in a broad sense\u2014so, for example, some art I would think useful and valuable, but other art might be otherwise for me. I was shocked to realize that some things are not worth acquiring, but now I think it is so. Some material things are white elephants that eat up the possessor\u2019s substance.  </p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The second lesson is of the transience of material being. This has not quite converted me to a dualist, but it has made some headway in that direction. I do not suppose that ideas are immortal, but certainly mental things are longer-lived than other material things. Once I was the sort of person who invests material objects with sentimental value. Now I no longer have those things, but I have the sentiments yet.   </p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Many times in my travels, I have lost everything but the clothes I was wearing and Lizbeth. The things I find in Dumpsters, the love letters and ragdolls of so many lives, remind me of this lesson. Now I hardly pick up a thing without envisioning the time I will cast it away. This I think is a healthy state of mind. Almost everything I have now has already been cast out at least once, proving that what I own is valueless to someone.  </p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Anyway, I find my desire to grab for the gaudy bauble has been largely sated. I think this is an attitude I share with the very wealthy\u2014we both know there is plenty more where what we have came from. Between us are the rat-race millions who have confounded their selves with the objects they grasp and who nightly scavenge the cable channels looking for they know not what. I am sorry for them.</p>",

        "author": "Pico Iyer",
        "type": "Essay",
        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The gods, they say, give breath, and they take it away. But the same could be said \u2014 could it not? \u2014 of the humble comma. Add it to the present clause, and, of a sudden, the mind is, quite literally, given pause to think; take it out if you wish or forget it and the mind is deprived of a resting place. Yet still the comma gets no respect. It seems just a slip of a thing, a pedant\u2019s tick, a blip on the edge of our consciousness, a kind of printer\u2019s smudge almost. Small, we claim, is beautiful (especially in the age of the microchip). Yet what is so often used, and so rarely recalled, as the comma \u2014 unless it be breath itself?</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Punctuation, one is taught, has a point: to keep up law and order. Punctuation marks are the road signs placed along the highway of our communication \u2014 to control speeds, provide directions and prevent head-on collisions. A period has the unblinking finality of a red light; the comma is a flashing yellow light that asks us only to slow down; and the semicolon is a stop sign that tells us to ease gradually to a halt, before gradually starting up again. By establishing the relations between words, punctuation establishes the relations between the people using words. That may be one reason why schoolteachers exalt it and lovers defy it (\u201cWe love each other and belong to each other let\u2019s don\u2019t ever hurt each other Nicole let\u2019s don\u2019t ever hurt each other,\u201d wrote Gary Gilmore to his girlfriend). A comma, he must have known, \u201cseparates inseparables,\u201d in the clinching words of H.W. Fowler, King of English Usage.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Punctuation, then, is a civic prop, a pillar that holds society upright. (A run-on sentence, its phrases piling up without division, is as unsightly as a sink piled high with dirty dishes.) Small wonder, then, that punctuation was one of the first proprieties of the Victorian age, the age of the corset, that the modernists threw off: the sexual revolution might be said to have begun when Joyce\u2019s Molly Bloom spilled out all her private thoughts in 36 pages of unbridled, almost unperioded and officially censored prose; and another rebellion was surely marked when E.E. Cummings first felt free to commit \u201cGod\u201d to the lower case.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Punctuation thus becomes the signature of cultures. The hot-blooded Spaniard seems to be revealed in the passion and urgency of his doubled exclamation points and question marks (\u201cCaramba! Quien sabe?\u201d), while the impassive Chinese traditionally added to his so-called inscrutability by omitting directions from his ideograms. The anarchy and commotion of the \u201960s were given voice in the exploding exclamation marks, riotous capital letters and Day-Glo italics of Tom Wolfe\u2019s spray-paint prose; and in Communist societies, where the State is absolute, the dignity \u2014 and divinity \u2014 of capital letters is reserved for Ministries, Sub-Committees and Secretariats.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yet punctuation is something more than a culture\u2019s birthmark; it scores the music in our minds, gets our thoughts moving to the rhythm of our hearts. Punctuation is the notation in the sheet music of our words, telling us when to rest, or when to raise our voices; it acknowledges that the meaning of our . discourse, as of any symphonic composition, lies not in the units but in the pauses, the pacing and the phrasing. Punctuation is the way one bats one\u2019s eyes, lowers one\u2019s voice or blushes demurely. Punctuation adjusts the tone and color and volume till the feeling comes into perfect focus: not disgust exactly, but distaste; not lust, or like, but love.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Punctuation, in short, gives us the human voice, and all the meanings that lie between the words. \u201cYou aren\u2019t young, are you?\u201d loses its innocence when it loses the question mark. Every child knows the menace of a dropped apostrophe (the parent\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t do that\u201d shifting into the more slowly enunciated \u201cDo not do that\u201d), and every believer, the ignominy of having his faith reduced to \u201cfaith.\u201d Add an exclamation point to \u201cTo be or not to be . . . \u201d and the gloomy Dane has all the resolve he needs; add a comma, and the noble sobriety of \u201cGod save the Queen\u201d becomes a cry of desperation bordering on double sacrilege.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Sometimes, of course, our markings may be simply a matter of aesthetics. Popping in a comma can be like slipping on the necklace that gives an outfit quiet elegance, or like catching the sound of running water that complements, as it completes, the silence of a Japanese landscape. When V.S. Naipaul, in his latest novel, writes, \u201cHe was a middle-aged man, with glasses,\u201d the first comma can seem a little precious. Yet it gives the description a spin, as well as a subtlety, that it otherwise lacks, and it shows that the glasses are not part of the middle-agedness, but something else.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Thus all these tiny scratches give us breadth and heft and depth. A world that has only periods is a world without inflections. It is a world without shade. It has a music without sharps and flats. It is a martial music. It has a jackboot rhythm. Words cannot bend and curve. A comma, by comparison, catches the gentle drift of the mind in thought, turning in on itself and back on itself, reversing, redoubling and returning along the course of its own sweet river music; while the semicolon brings clauses and thoughts together with all the silent discretion of a hostess arranging guests around her dinner table.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Punctuation, then, is a matter of care. Care for words, yes, but also, and more important, for what the words imply. Only a lover notices the small things: the way the afternoon light catches the nape of a neck, or how a strand of hair slips out from behind an ear, or the way a finger curls around a cup. And no one scans a letter so closely as a lover, searching for its small print, straining to hear its nuances, its gasps, its sighs and hesitations, poring over the secret messages that lie in every cadence. The difference between \u201cJane (whom I adore)\u201d and \u201cJane, whom I adore,\u201d and the difference between them both and \u201cJane \u2014 whom I adore \u2014 \u201d marks all the distance between ecstasy and heartache. \u201cNo iron can pierce the heart with such force as a period put at just the right place,\u201d in Isaac Babel\u2019s lovely words; a comma can let us hear a voice break, or a heart. Punctuation, in fact, is a labor of love. Which brings us back, in a way, to gods.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But 100 years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men \u2014 yes, Black men as well as white men \u2014 would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.</p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny.</p><p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone. And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.</p><p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, when will you be satisfied? We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.</p><p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: for whites only.</p><p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.</p><p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.</p>",

I know there are a great many people affected by the orders which we have made who are the passionate enemies of Nazi Germany. I am very sorry for them, but we cannot, at the present time and under the present stress, draw all the distinctions which we should like to do. If parachute landings were attempted and fierce fighting attendant upon them followed, these unfortunate people would be far better out of the way, for their own sakes as well as for ours. There is, however, another class, for which I feel not the slightest sympathy. Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House, without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively stamped out.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye.

At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty\u2019s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God\u2019s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.</p>",

        "type": "Speech",
        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Over there, behind the black gates of Auschwitz, the most tragic of all prisoners were the \"Muselmanner,\" as they were called. Wrapped in their torn blankets, they would sit or lie on the ground, staring vacantly into space, unaware of who or where they were -- strangers to their surroundings. They no longer felt pain, hunger, thirst. They feared nothing. They felt nothing. They were dead and did not know it.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Rooted in our tradition, some of us felt that to be abandoned by humanity then was not the ultimate. We felt that to be abandoned by God was worse than to be punished by Him. Better an unjust God than an indifferent one. For us to be ignored by God was a harsher punishment than to be a victim of His anger. Man can live far from God -- not outside God. God is wherever we are. Even in suffering? Even in suffering.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In a way, to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the human being inhuman. Indifference, after all, is more dangerous than anger and hatred. Anger can at times be creative. One writes a great poem, a great symphony. One does something special for the sake of humanity because one is angry at the injustice that one witnesses. But indifference is never creative. Even hatred at times may elicit a response. You fight it. You denounce it. You disarm it.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Indifference elicits no response. Indifference is not a response. Indifference is not a beginning; it is an end. And, therefore, indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten. The political prisoner in his cell, the hungry children, the homeless refugees -- not to respond to their plight, not to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile them from human memory. And in denying their humanity, we betray our own.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Indifference, then, is not only a sin, it is a punishment.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And this is one of the most important lessons of this outgoing century's wide-ranging experiments in good and evil.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the place that I come from, society was composed of three simple categories: the killers, the victims, and the bystanders. During the darkest of times, inside the ghettoes and death camps -- and I'm glad that Mrs. Clinton mentioned that we are now commemorating that event, that period, that we are now in the Days of Remembrance -- but then, we felt abandoned, forgotten. All of us did.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And our only miserable consolation was that we believed that Auschwitz and Treblinka were closely guarded secrets; that the leaders of the free world did not know what was going on behind those black gates and barbed wire; that they had no knowledge of the war against the Jews that Hitler's armies and their accomplices waged as part of the war against the Allies. If they knew, we thought, surely those leaders would have moved heaven and earth to intervene. They would have spoken out with great outrage and conviction. They would have bombed the railways leading to Birkenau, just the railways, just once.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And now we knew, we learned, we discovered that the Pentagon knew, the State Department knew. And the illustrious occupant of the White House then, who was a great leader -- and I say it with some anguish and pain, because, today is exactly 54 years marking his death -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt died on April the 12th, 1945. So he is very much present to me and to us. No doubt, he was a great leader. He mobilized the American people and the world, going into battle, bringing hundreds and thousands of valiant and brave soldiers in America to fight fascism, to fight dictatorship, to fight Hitler. And so many of the young people fell in battle. And, nevertheless, his image in Jewish history -- I must say it -- his image in Jewish history is flawed.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The depressing tale of the St. Louis is a case in point. Sixty years ago, its human cargo -- nearly 1,000 Jews -- was turned back to Nazi Germany. And that happened after the Kristallnacht, after the first state sponsored pogrom, with hundreds of Jewish shops destroyed, synagogues burned, thousands of people put in concentration camps. And that ship, which was already in the shores of the United States, was sent back. I don't understand. Roosevelt was a good man, with a heart. He understood those who needed help.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Why didn't he allow these refugees to disembark? A thousand people -- in America, the great country, the greatest democracy, the most generous of all new nations in modern history. What happened? I don't understand. Why the indifference, on the highest level, to the suffering of the victims?</p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But then, there were human beings who were sensitive to our tragedy. Those non-Jews, those Christians, that we call the \"Righteous Gentiles,\" whose selfless acts of heroism saved the honor of their faith. Why were they so few? Why was there a greater effort to save SS murderers after the war than to save their victims during the war? Why did some of America's largest corporations continue to do business with Hitler's Germany until 1942? It has been suggested, and it was documented, that the Wehrmacht could not have conducted its invasion of France without oil obtained from American sources. How is one to explain their indifference?</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, six-two or six-three, clear-eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us? I thought of more than 900 service men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or with nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists. When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Now let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A belief that we are connected as one people. If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother. If there's an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It's that fundamental belief - I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper - that makes this country work. It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. \"E pluribus unum.\" Out of many, one.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America - there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here - the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope!</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead. I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America!</p>",

This is truly a celebration - It is also a coming together\u2026 </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Our goals for this Conference, to strengthen families and societies by empowering women to take greater control over their own destinies, cannot be fully achieved unless all governments - here and around the world - accept their responsibility to protect and promote internationally recognized human rights. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The international community has long acknowledged that both women and men are entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms, from the right of personal security to the right to determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear.  </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution, arrest, abuse or torture. Tragically, women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated.  </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Even in the late 20th century, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict. Women and children make up a large majority of the world's refugees. When women are excluded from the political process, they become even more vulnerable to abuse.  </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I believe that it is time to break our silence. It is time for us to say here in Beijing, and the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights.  </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>These abuses have continued because, for too long, the history of women has been a history of silence. Even today, there are those who are trying to silence our words. The voices of this conference   must be heard loud and clear: It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls.  </p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution.  </p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline, set on fire and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small.  </p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war.  </p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes.  </p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families, and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will.  </p><p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, it is that human rights are women's rights - and women's rights are human rights. Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely - and the right to be heard.  </p><p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Women must enjoy the right to participate fully in the social and political lives of their countries if we want freedom and democracy to thrive and endure.  </p><p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Let me be clear. Freedom means the right of people to assemble, organize, and debate openly. It means respecting the views of those who may disagree with the views of their governments. It means not taking citizens away from their loved ones and jailing them, mistreating them, or denying them their freedom or dignity because of the peaceful expression of their ideas and opinions.  </p><p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Now it is time to act on behalf of women everywhere. If we take bold steps to better the lives of women, we will be taking bold steps to better the lives of children and families too.  </p><p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As long as discrimination and inequities remain so commonplace around the world - as long as girls and women are valued less, fed less, fed last, overworked, underpaid, not schooled and subjected to violence in and out of their homes - the potential of the human family to create a peaceful, prosperous world will not be realized.  </p><p><em>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Let this Conference be our - and the world's - call to action.  </p><p><em>19nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And let us heed the call so that we can create a world in which every woman is treated with respect and dignity, every boy and girl is loved and cared for equally, and every family has the hope of a strong and stable future. God's blessings on you, your work and all who will benefit from it.  </p><p><em>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Thank you very much. </p>",

But we must recognize that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Our goals for this conference, to strengthen families and societies by empowering women to take greater control over their own destinies, cannot be fully achieved unless all governments -- here and around the world -- accept their responsibility to protect and promote internationally recognized human rights. The -- The international community has long acknowledged and recently reaffirmed at Vienna that both women and men are entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms, from the right of personal security to the right to determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear. No one -- No one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution, arrest, abuse, or torture.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Tragically, women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated. Even now, in the late 20th century, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict. Women and children make up a large majority of the world\u2019s refugees. And when women are excluded from the political process, they become even more vulnerable to abuse. I believe that now, on the eve of a new millennium, it is time to break the silence. It is time for us to say here in Beijing, and for the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women\u2019s rights as separate from human rights.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>. . . This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen. . . .</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite these holocausts America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this pre-eminence, we yet realize that America\u2019s leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Throughout America\u2019s adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations. . . .</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile ideology \u2013 global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. . . .</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>. . . [T]hreats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. I mention two only.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence \u2013 economic, political, even spiritual \u2013 is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.</p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.</p><p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.</p><p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.</p><p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The prospect of domination of the nation\u2019s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present \u2013 and is gravely to be regarded.</p><p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.</p><p><em>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system \u2013 ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society. . . .</p>",

For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind\u2019s final war.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So let us begin anew\u2014remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.

It's one or the other in 1964. It isn't that time is running out &mdash; time has run out!</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has ever witnessed. The most explosive year. Why? It's also a political year. It's the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the so-called Negro community jiving you and me for some votes. The year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises, building up our hopes for a letdown, with their trickery and their treachery, with their false promises which they don't intend to keep. As they nourish these dissatisfactions, it can only lead to one thing, an explosion; and now we have the type of black man on the scene in America today &mdash; I'm sorry, Brother Lomax &mdash; who just doesn't intend to turn the other cheek any longer.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Don't let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you. If they draft you, they send you to Korea and make you face 800 million Chinese. If you can be brave over there, you can be brave right here. These odds aren't as great as those odds. And if you fight here, you will at least know what you're fighting for.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I'm not a politician, not even a student of politics; in fact, I'm not a student of much of anything. I'm not a Democrat. I'm not a Republican, and I don't even consider myself an American. If you and I were Americans, there'd be no problem. Those Honkies that just got off the boat, they're already Americans; Polacks are already Americans; the Italian refugees are already Americans. Everything that came out of Europe, every blue-eyed thing, is already an American. And as long as you and I have been over here, we aren't Americans yet.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Well, I am one who doesn't believe in deluding myself. I'm not going to sit at your table and watch you eat, with nothing on my plate, and call myself a diner. Sitting at the table doesn't make you a diner, unless you eat some of what's on that plate. Being here in America doesn't make you an American. Being born here in America doesn't make you an American. Why, if birth made you American, you wouldn't need any legislation; you wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution; you wouldn't be faced with civil-rights filibustering in Washington, D.C., right now. They don't have to pass civil-rights legislation to make a Polack an American.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>No, I'm not an American. I'm one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of Americanism. One of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy, nothing but disguised hypocrisy. So, I'm not standing here speaking to you as an American, or a patriot, or a flag-saluter, or a flag-waver &mdash; no, not I. I'm speaking as a victim of this American system. And I see America through the eyes of the victim. I don't see any American dream; I see an American nightmare.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>These 22 million victims are waking up. Their eyes are coming open. They're beginning to see what they used to only look at. They're becoming politically mature. They are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast. As they see these new political trends, it's possible for them to see that every time there's an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount. They had to recount in Massachusetts to see who was going to be governor, it was so close. It was the same way in Rhode Island, in Minnesota, and in many other parts of the country. And the same with Kennedy and Nixon when they ran for president. It was so close they had to count all over again. Well, what does this mean? It means that when white people are evenly divided, and black people have a bloc of votes of their own, it is left up to them to determine who's going to sit in the White House and who's going to be in the dog house.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>lt was the black man's vote that put the present administration in Washington, D.C. Your vote, your dumb vote, your ignorant vote, your wasted vote put in an administration in Washington, D.C., that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable, saving you until last, then filibustering on top of that. And your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress we're making. And what a good president we have. If he wasn't good in Texas, he sure can't be good in Washington, D.C. Because Texas is a lynch state. It is in the same breath as Mississippi, no different; only they lynch you in Texas with a Texas accent and lynch you in Mississippi with a Mississippi accent. And these Negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the White House with a Texan, a Southern cracker &mdash; that's all he is &mdash; and then come out and tell you and me that he's going to be better for us because, since he's from the South, he knows how to deal with the Southerners. What kind of logic is that? Let Eastland be president, he's from the South too. He should be better able to deal with them than Johnson.</p>",

Early on, my mother lost $61.20\u2014a reading fee charged by a so-called agent to look at one of my unpublished stories. No one had told us that agents weren\u2019t supposed to get any money up front, weren\u2019t supposed to be paid until they sold your work. Then they were to take ten percent of whatever the work earned. Ignorance is expensive. That $61.20 was more money back then than my mother paid for a month\u2019s rent.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I badgered friends and acquaintances into reading my work, and they seemed to like it. Teachers read it and said kindly, unhelpful things. But there were no creative writing classes at my high school, and no useful criticism. At college (in California at that time, junior college was almost free), I took classes taught by an elderly woman who wrote children\u2019s stories. She was polite about the science fiction and fantasy that I kept handing in, but she finally asked in exasperation, \u201cCan\u2019t you write anything normal?\u201d</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A schoolwide contest was held. All submissions had to be made anonymously. My short story won first prize. I was an eighteen-year-old freshman, and I won in spite of competition from older, more experienced people. Beautiful. The $15.00 prize was the first money my writing earned me.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>After college I did office work for a while, then factory and warehouse work. My size and strength were advantages in factories and warehouses. And no one expected me to smile and pretend I was having a good time.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I got up at two or three in the morning and wrote. Then I went to work. I hated it, and I have no gift for suffering in silence. I muttered and complained and quit jobs and found new ones and collected more rejection slips. One day in disgust I threw them all away. Why keep such useless, painful things?</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There seems to be an unwritten rule, hurtful and at odds with the realities of American culture. It says you aren\u2019t supposed to wonder whether as a Black person, a Black woman, you really might be inferior\u2014not quite bright enough, not quite quick enough, not quite good enough to do the things you want to do. Though of course you do wonder. You\u2019re supposed to <em>know</em> you\u2019re as good as anyone. And if you don\u2019t know, you aren\u2019t supposed to admit it. If anyone near you admits it, you\u2019re supposed to reassure them quickly so they\u2019ll shut up. That sort of talk is embarrassing. Act tough and confident and don\u2019t talk about your doubts. If you never deal with them, you may never get rid of them, but no matter. Fake everyone out. Even yourself.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I couldn\u2019t fake myself out. I didn\u2019t talk much about my doubts. I wasn\u2019t fishing for hasty reassurances. But I did a lot of thinking\u2014the same things over and over.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Who was I anyway? Why should anyone pay attention to what I had to say? Did I have anything to say? I was writing science fiction and fantasy, for God\u2019s sake. At that time nearly all professional science-fiction writers were white men. As much as I loved science fiction and fantasy, what was I doing?</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Well, whatever it was, I couldn\u2019t stop. Positive obsession is about not being able to stop just because you\u2019re afraid and full of doubts. Positive obsession is dangerous. It\u2019s about not being able to stop at all.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I was twenty-three when, finally, I sold my first two short stories. I sold both to writer-editors who were teaching at Clarion, a science-fiction writers\u2019 workshop that I was attending. One story was eventually published. The other wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t sell another word for five years. Then, finally, I sold my first novel. Thank God no one told me selling would take so long\u2014not that I would have believed it. I\u2019ve sold eight novels since then. Last Christmas, I paid off the mortgage on my mother\u2019s house.</p>",

Escaping a dire economic situation at home, they moved to New Jersey, where they had friends and family, seeking a better life, and then moved to Boston after I was born.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Throughout my childhood I watched my parents try to become legal but to no avail. They lost their money to people they believed to be attorneys, but who ultimately never helped. That meant my childhood was haunted by the fear that they would be deported. If I didn\u2019t see anyone when I walked in the door after school, I panicked.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And then one day, my fears were realized. I came home from school to an empty house. Lights were on and dinner had been started, but my family wasn\u2019t there. Neighbors broke the news that my parents had been taken away by immigration officers, and just like that, my stable family life was over.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Not a single person at any level of government took any note of me. No one checked to see if I had a place to live or food to eat, and at 14, I found myself basically on my own.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>While awaiting deportation proceedings, my parents remained in detention near Boston, so I could visit them. They would have liked to fight deportation, but without a lawyer, and with an immigration system that rarely gives judges the discretion to allow families to stay together, they never had a chance. Finally, they agreed for me to continue my education at Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, and the parents of friends graciously took me in.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I was lucky to have good friends, but I had a rocky existence. I was always insecure about being a nuisance and losing my invitation to stay. I worked a variety of jobs in retail and at coffee shops all through high school. And, though I was surrounded by people who cared about me, part of me ached with every accomplishment, because my parents weren\u2019t there to share my joy.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>My family and I worked hard to keep our relationships strong, but too-short phone calls and the annual summer visits I made to Colombia didn\u2019t suffice. They missed many important events in my life, including my singing recitals\u2014they watched my senior recital on a tape I sent them instead of from the audience. And they missed my prom, my college application process and my graduations from high school and college.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>My story is all too common. Every day, children who are U.S. citizens are separated from their families as a result of immigration policies that need fixing.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I consider myself lucky because things turned out better for me than for most, including some of my own family members. When my brother was deported, his daughter was just a toddler. She still had her mother, but in a single-parent household, she faced a lot of challenges. My niece made the wrong friends and bad choices. Today, she is serving time in jail, living the reality that I act out on screen.<span><span>*</span><span>A reference to the author\u2019s role in the Netflix series <span>Orange Is the New Black</span>.</span></span> I don\u2019t believe her life would have turned out this way if her father and my parents had been here to guide and support her.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I realize the issues are complicated. But it\u2019s not just in the interest of immigrants to fix the system: It\u2019s in the interest of all Americans. Children who grow up separated from their families often end up in foster care, or worse, in the juvenile justice system despite having parents who love them and would like to be able to care for them.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I don\u2019t believe it reflects our values as a country to separate children and parents in this way. Nor does it reflect our values to hold people in detention without access to good legal representation or a fair shot in a court of law.</p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>President Obama has promised to act on providing deportation relief for families across the country, and I would urge him to do so quickly. Keeping families together is a core American value.</p><p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Congress needs to provide a permanent, fair legislative solution, but in the meantime families are being destroyed every day, and the president should do everything in his power to provide the broadest relief possible now.

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Celebrity distinguishes itself from other forms of public approbation because it centers on the individual personality. In their seemingly immortal perfection, celebrities offer us escape from the mundane, they entertain us, they give us pleasure or help us express our pain. In their all-too-human imperfection, they reassure us about our own shortcomings, foster a sense of belonging, and remind us that struggle is simply a condition of the human experience. Celebrities reflect our personhood; they show us who we are. But they also charm us with illusion, showing us whom we want to be.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>More ambiguous than fame is celebrity, which derived from the Latin <em>celebrem</em>, a word that implied both the celebration and the potential \u2018crowding\u2019 (perhaps we would say \u2018mobbing\u2019) of an individual. Fame could be bestowed upon an individual because of her good deeds but also because of her elevated hereditary position: the queen was famous simply because she was queen. Relying as it does upon a measure of external scrutiny, however, celebrity implied a reciprocity between the esteemed and the public that made its conferral less a designation and more a process of negotiation. Unlike \u2018fame\u2019 and \u2018renown\u2019, which connoted respect and reverence, \u2018celebrity\u2019, coming into popular use in the 18th century, aroused suspicion. It strove for legitimacy and struggled against critiques of excess and superficiality. Celebrity was collectively constituted and mediated in ways that fame was not. Fame needed a notable person; celebrity required a judicious audience.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Celebrity culture continues to elicit contradictory responses. On the one hand, entangled with older systems of fame production and enmeshed within the 20th-century star system, contemporary celebrity, like its predecessors, confuses the authentic and the artificial; draws attention to the unique, the different and the talented; and captures a fleeting moment, providing a snapshot of a shared social reality as fragile and ephemeral as celebrity itself. As aspirational avatars, idolized icons and vessels of collective memory, celebrities permeate all aspects of modern life. On the other hand, celebrity also inspires derision, even disdain. It arouses animosity or, at the very least, fosters ambivalence. Historian and political conservative Daniel Boorstin in the 1960s cynically characterized celebrity as an artifice perpetrated and sustained by an equally vapid and manipulative mass media.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Moreover, in the era of reality TV casts, social-media influencers, YouTube personalities, bloggers, vloggers and Instagrammers, it would seem that anyone might become, in Boorstin\u2019s perhaps prophetic words, \u2018known for their knownness\u2019. Indeed, whether we regard ourselves as indifferent publics or eager spectators, by continuing to debate which bodies are worthy \u2013 whether by endeavoring to keep up with or preferring to keep away from the Kardashians \u2013 we remain entangled in celebrity\u2019s snare. Whether we like it or not, those fascinating, reproducible individuals known, if only for their knownness, continue to give us something to talk about.</p>",

Probably the best test of true love of liberty in any country is the way in which minorities are treated in that country. Not only should there be complete liberty in matters of religion and opinion, but complete liberty for each man to lead his life as he desires, provided only that in so doing he does not wrong his neighbors.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Persecution is bad because it is persecution, and without reference to which side happens at the moment to be the persecutor and which the persecuted. Class hatred is bad in just the same way, and without any regard to the individual who at a given time substitutes loyalty to a class for loyalty to the nation, or substitutes hatred of men because they happen to come in a certain social category for judgment awarded them according to their conduct.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The man who, if born to wealth and power, exploits and ruins his less fortunate brethren is at heart the same as the greedy and violent demagogue who excites those who have not property to plunder those who have. The gravest wrong upon his country is inflicted by that man, whatever his station, who seeks to make his countrymen divide primarily on the line that separates class from class, occupation from occupation, men of more wealth from men of less wealth, instead of remembering that the only safe standard is that which judges each man on his worth as a man, whether he be rich or poor, without regard to his profession or to his station in life.</p> </div></div>",

And by that definition, I am someone who has always loved language. I am fascinated by language in daily life. I spend a great deal of my time thinking about the power of language\u2014the way it can evoke an emotion, a visual image, a complex idea, or a simple truth. Language is the tool of my trade. And I use them all\u2014all the Englishes I grew up with.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Recently, I was made keenly aware of the different Englishes I do use. I was giving a talk to a large group of people, the same talk I had already given to half a dozen other groups. The nature of the talk was about my writing, my life, and my book <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>. The talk was going along well enough, until I remembered one major difference that made the whole talk sound wrong. My mother was in the room. And it was perhaps the first time she had heard me give a lengthy speech using the kind of English I have never used with her. I was saying things like, \u201cThe intersection of memory upon imagination\u201d and \u201cThere is an aspect of my fiction that relates to thus-and-thus\u201d\u2014a speech filled with carefully wrought grammatical phrases, burdened, it suddenly seemed to me, with nominalized forms, past perfect tenses, conditional phrases, all the forms of standard English that I had learned in school and through books, the forms of English I did not use at home with my mother.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Just last week, I was walking down the street with my mother, and I again found myself conscious of the English I was using, the English I do use with her. We were talking about the price of new and used furniture and I heard myself saying this: \u201cNot waste money that way.\u201d My husband was with us as well, and he didn\u2019t notice any switch in my English. And then I realized why. It\u2019s because over the twenty years we\u2019ve been together I\u2019ve often used that same kind of English with him, and sometimes he even uses it with me. It has become our language of intimacy, a different sort of English that relates to family talk, the language I grew up with.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So you\u2019ll have some idea of what this family talk I heard sounds like, I\u2019ll quote what my mother said during a recent conversation which I videotaped and then transcribed. During this conversation, my mother was talking about a political gangster in Shanghai who had the same last name as her family\u2019s, Du, and how the gangster in his early years wanted to be adopted by her family, which was rich by comparison. Later, the gangster became more powerful, far richer than my mother\u2019s family, and one day showed up at my mother\u2019s wedding to pay his respects. Here\u2019s what she said in part:</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cDu Yusong having business like fruit stand. Like off the street kind. He is Du like Du Zong\u2014but not Tsung-ming Island people. The local people call putong, the river east side, he belong to that side local people. That man want to ask Du Zong father take him in like become own family. Du Zong father wasn\u2019t look down on him, but didn\u2019t take seriously, until that man big like become a mafia. Now important person, very hard to inviting him. Chinese way, came only to show respect, don\u2019t stay for dinner. Respect for making big celebration, he shows up. Mean gives lots of respect. Chinese custom. Chinese social life that way. If too important won\u2019t have to stay too long. He come to my wedding. I didn\u2019t see, I heard it. I gone to boy\u2019s side, they have YMCA dinner. Chinese age I was nineteen.\u201d</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You should know that my mother\u2019s expressive command of English belies how much she actually understands. She reads the <em>Forbes </em>report, listens to <em>Wall Street Week</em>, converses daily with her stockbroker, reads all of Shirley MacLaine\u2019s books with ease\u2014all kinds of things I can\u2019t begin to understand. Yet some of my friends tell me they understand 50 percent of what my mother says. Some say they understand 80 to 90 percent. Some say they understand none of it, as if she were speaking pure Chinese. But to me, my mother\u2019s English is perfectly clear, perfectly natural. It\u2019s my mother tongue. Her language, as I hear it, is vivid, direct, full of observation and imagery. That was the language that helped shape the way I saw things, expressed things, made sense of the world.</p>",

        "text": "<p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But a far more important correction, applicable to the common vague idea of literature, is to be sought, not so much in a better definition of literature, as in a sharper distinction of the two functions which it fulfils. In that great social organ which, collectively, we call literature, there may be distinguished two separate offices, that may blend and often <em>do</em> so, but capable, severally, of a severe insulation, and naturally fitted for reciprocal repulsion. There is, first, the literature of <em>knowledge,</em> and, secondly, the literature of <em>power</em>. The function of the first is to <em>teach</em>; the function of the second is to <em>move</em>: the first is a rudder; the second an oar or a sail. The first speaks to the <em>mere</em> discursive understanding; the second speaks ultimately, it may happen, to the higher understanding, or reason, but always <em>through</em> affections of pleasure and sympathy. Remotely it may travel towards an object seated in what Lord Bacon calls <em>dry</em> light; but proximately it does and must operate\u2014else it ceases to be a literature of <em>power\u2014</em>on and through that <em>humid</em> light which clothes itself in the mists and glittering <em>iris</em><sup>1</sup> of human passions, desires, and genial emotions. Men have so little reflected on the higher functions of literature as to find it a paradox if one should describe it as a mean or subordinate purpose of books to give information. But this is a paradox only in the sense which makes it honorable to be paradoxical. Whenever we talk in ordinary language of seeking information or gaining knowledge, we understand the words as connected with something of absolute novelty. But it is the grandeur of all truth which <em>can</em> occupy a very high place in human interests that it is never absolutely novel to the meanest of minds: it exists eternally, by way of germ or latent principle, in the lowest as in the highest, needing to be developed but never to be planted. To be capable of transplantation is the immediate criterion of a truth that ranges on a lower scale. Besides which, there is a rarer thing than truth, namely, <em>power</em>, or deep sympathy with truth. What is the effect, for instance, upon society, of children? By the pity, by the tenderness, and by the peculiar modes of admiration, which connect themselves with the helplessness, with the innocence, and with the simplicity of children, not only are the primal affections strengthened and continually renewed, but the qualities which are dearest in the sight of heaven\u2014the frailty, for instance, which appeals to forbearance, the innocence which symbolizes the heavenly, and the simplicity which is most alien from the worldly\u2014are kept up in perpetual remembrance, and their ideals are continually refreshed. A purpose of the same nature is answered by the higher literature, <em>viz</em>., the literature of power. What do you learn from <em>Paradise Lost</em>? Nothing at all. What do you learn from a cookery-book? Something new, something that you did not know before, in every paragraph. But would you therefore put the wretched cookery-book on a higher level of estimation than the divine poem? What you owe to Milton is not any knowledge, of which a million separate items are still but a million of advancing steps on the same earthly level; what you owe is <em>power</em>, that is, exercise and expansion to your own latent capacity of sympathy with the infinite, where every pulse and each separate influx is a step upwards, a step ascending as upon a Jacob\u2019s ladder<sup>2</sup> from earth to mysterious altitudes above the earth. <em>All</em> the steps of knowledge, from first to last, carry you further on the same plane, but could never raise you one foot above your ancient level of earth; whereas the very <em>first</em> step in power is a flight, is an ascending movement into another element where earth is forgotten.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>Rainbow</span><br><sup>2</sup>In the Bible, Jacob has a vision of angels ascending and descending a ladder to Heaven.</span></p></small>",

There is racial privilege, gender (and identity) privilege, heterosexual privilege, economic privilege, able-bodied privilege, educational privilege, religious privilege, and the list goes on and on. At some point, you have to surrender to the kinds of privilege you hold. Nearly everyone, particularly in the developed world, has something someone else doesn\u2019t, something someone else yearns for.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The problem is, cultural critics talk about privilege with such alarming frequency and in such empty ways, we have diluted the word\u2019s meaning. When people wield the word \u201cprivilege,\u201d it tends to fall on deaf ears because we hear that word so damn much it has become white noise.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>One of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever had to do is accept and acknowledge my privilege. It\u2019s an ongoing project. I\u2019m a woman, a person of color, and the child of immigrants, but I also grew up middle class and then upper middle class. My parents raised my siblings and me in a strict but loving environment. They were and are happily married, so I didn\u2019t have to deal with divorce or crappy intramarital dynamics. I attended elite schools. My master\u2019s and doctoral degrees were funded. I got a tenure-track position my first time out. My bills are paid. I have the time and resources for frivolity. I am reasonably well published. I have an agent and books to my name. My life has been far from perfect, but it\u2019s somewhat embarrassing for me to accept just how much privilege I have.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It\u2019s also really difficult for me to consider the ways in which I lack privilege or the ways in which my privilege hasn\u2019t magically rescued me from a world of hurt. On my more difficult days, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more of a pain in my ass\u2014being black or being a woman. I\u2019m happy to be both of these things, but the world keeps intervening. There are all kinds of infuriating reminders of my place in the world\u2014random people questioning me in the parking lot at work as if it is unfathomable that I\u2019m a faculty member, the persistence of lawmakers trying to legislate the female body, street harassment, strangers wanting to touch my hair.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We tend to believe that accusations of privilege imply we have it easy, which we resent because life is hard for nearly everyone. Of course we resent these accusations. Look at white men when they are accused of having privilege. They tend to be immediately defensive (and, at times, understandably so). They say, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault I am a white man,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m [insert other condition that discounts their privilege],\u201d instead of simply accepting that, in this regard, yes, they benefit from certain privileges others do not. To have privilege in one or more areas does not mean you are wholly privileged. Surrendering to the acceptance of privilege is difficult, but it is really all that is expected. What I remind myself, regularly, is this: the acknowledgment of my privilege is not a denial of the ways I have been and am marginalized, the ways I have suffered.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You don\u2019t necessarily <i>have</i> to do anything once you acknowledge your privilege. You don\u2019t have to apologize for it. You need to understand the extent of your privilege, the consequences of your privilege, and remain aware that people who are different from you move through and experience the world in ways you might never know anything about. They might endure situations you can never know anything about. You could, however, use that privilege for the greater good\u2014to try to level the playing field for everyone, to work for social justice, to bring attention to how those without certain privileges are disenfranchised. We\u2019ve seen what the hoarding of privilege has done, and the results are shameful.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When we talk about privilege, some people start to play a very pointless and dangerous game where they try to mix and match various demographic characteristics to determine who wins at the Game of Privilege. Who would win in a privilege battle between a wealthy black woman and a wealthy white man? Who would win a privilege battle between a queer white man and a queer Asian woman? Who would win in a privilege battle between a working-class white man and a wealthy, differently abled Mexican woman? We could play this game all day and never find a winner. Playing the Game of Privilege is mental masturbation\u2014it only feels good to those playing the game.</p></div></div>",

Regardless of the content of any one of these experiences, no one in his or her right mind would doubt their reality. Any experience of consciousness\u2014from the most mundane to the most elevated\u2014has a certain coherence and, at the same time, a high degree of privacy, which means that it always exists from a particular point of view. The experience of consciousness is entirely subjective. The paradox, however, is that despite the indubitable reality of our subjectivity and thousands of years of philosophical examination, there is little consensus on what consciousness is. Science, with its characteristic third-person method\u2014the objective perspective from the outside\u2014has made strikingly little headway in this understanding.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There is, however, a growing recognition that the study of consciousness is becoming a most exciting area of scientific investigation. At the same time, there is a growing acknowledgment that modern science does not yet possess a fully developed methodology to investigate the phenomenon of consciousness. This is not to say that there have been no philosophical theories on the subject, or that there have been no efforts to \u201cexplain\u201d consciousness in terms of material paradigms. At one extreme was the standpoint of behaviorism, which attempted to define consciousness in terms of the language of external behavior, thus reducing mental phenomena to verbal and bodily action. At the other extreme was what is known as Cartesian dualism, the idea that the world comprises two independent, substantially real things\u2014matter, which is characterized by qualities such as extension, and mind, which is defined in terms of an immaterial substance, such as the \u201cspirit.\u201d Between these two extremes all kinds of theories have been proposed, from functionalism (which attempts to define consciousness in terms of its functions) to neurophenomenology (which attempts to define consciousness in terms of neural correlates). Most of these theories understand consciousness by means of aspects of the material world.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But what about the direct observation of consciousness itself? What are its characteristics and how does it function? Does all of life (plants as well as animals) share in it? Does our conscious life exist only when we are aware of being conscious, so that in dreamless sleep, for example, consciousness may be said to be dormant, or even annihilated? Is consciousness composed of serial moments of mental fluctuation, or is it continuous but continually changing? Is consciousness a matter of degree? Does consciousness always need an object\u2014something to be conscious <em>of</em>? What is its relation to the unconscious\u2014not only the unconscious electrochemical events of the brain that are correlated with mental processes but also more complex and perhaps problematic unconscious desires, memories, and expectations? Given the highly subjective nature of our experience of consciousness, is a scientific understanding\u2014in the sense of an objective, third-person account\u2014ever possible?</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The question of consciousness has attracted a good deal of attention in the long history of Buddhist philosophical thinking. For Buddhism, given its primary interest in questions of ethics, spirituality, and overcoming suffering, understanding consciousness, which is thought to be a defining characteristic of sentience, is of great importance. According to the earliest scriptures, the Buddha saw consciousness as playing a key role in determining the course of human happiness and suffering. For example, the famous discourse of the Buddha known as the <em>Dhammapada</em><sup>1</sup> opens with the statement that mind is primary and pervades all things.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Before we proceed, it is important to be aware of the problems raised by our use of language in describing subjective experience. Despite the universality of the experience of consciousness, the languages in which we articulate our subjective experiences have their roots in disparate cultural, historical, and linguistic backgrounds. These diverse backgrounds represent different cognitive frameworks\u2014conceptual mapping, linguistic practices, or philosophical and spiritual heritage. For example, in Western European languages, one speaks of \u201cconsciousness,\u201d \u201cthe mind,\u201d \u201cmental phenomena,\u201d and \u201cawareness.\u201d Similarly, in the context of Buddhist philosophy of mind, one speaks of <em>lo</em> (<em>buddhi</em> in Sanskrit), <em>shepa</em> (<em>j\u00f1ana</em>), and <em>rigpa</em> (<em>vidya</em>)\u2014all of which can be roughly translated as awareness or \u201cintelligence\u201d in the broadest sense of the term. Buddhist philosophers also speak of <em>sem</em> (<em>citta</em> in Sanskrit), \u201cmind\u201d in English; <em>namshe</em> (<em>vijnana</em> in Sanskrit), \u201cconsciousness\u201d; and <em>yi</em> (<em>manas</em> in Sanskrit), \u201cmentality\u201d or \u201cmental states.\u201d</p></div><hr><div><small><p><sup>1</sup>Collection of the Buddha\u2019s sayings in verse form, widely studied in Theravada Buddhism</p></div></small></div>",

Consequently it is very exasperating to sit, open-eyed and expectant, watching the removal of the successive swathings which hide from you the dusky glories of an old-time princess, and, when the unrolling is over, to find it is nothing, after all, but a great lubberly boy. Equally trying is to feel your interest clustering round a narrator\u2019s manhood, all your individuality merging in his, till, of a sudden, by the merest chance, you catch the swell of crinoline, and there you are. Away with such clumsiness! Let us have everybody christened before we begin.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I do, therefore, with Spartan firmness, depose and say that I am a woman. I am aware that I place myself at signal disadvantage by the avowal. I fly in the face of hereditary prejudice. I am thrust at once beyond the pale of masculine sympathy. Men will neither credit my success nor lament my failure, because they will consider me poaching on their manor. If I chronicle a big beet, they will bring forward one twice as large. If I mourn a deceased squash, they will mutter, \u201cWoman\u2019s farming!\u201d Shunning Scylla, I shall perforce fall into Charybdis. (<em>Vide</em> Classical Dictionary. I have lent mine, but I know one was a rock and the other a whirlpool, though I cannot state, with any definiteness, which was which.) I may be as humble and deprecating as I choose, but it will not avail me. A very agony of self-abasement will be no armor against the poisoned shafts which assumed superiority will hurl against me. Yet I press the arrow to my bleeding heart, and calmly reiterate, I am a woman.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The full magnanimity of which reiteration can be perceived only when I inform you that I could easily deceive you, if I chose. There is about my serious style a vigor of thought, a comprehensiveness of view, a closeness of logic, and a terseness of diction, commonly supposed to pertain only to the stronger sex. Not wanting in a certain fanciful sprightliness which is the peculiar grace of woman, it possesses also, in large measure, that concentrativeness which is deemed the peculiar strength of man. Where an ordinary woman will leave the beaten track, wandering in a thousand little byways of her own\u2014flowery and beautiful, it is true, and leading her airy feet to \u201csunny spots of greenery\u201d and the gleam of golden apples, but keeping her not less surely from the goal,\u2014I march straight on, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left, beguiled into no side-issues, discussing no collateral question, but with keen eye and strong hand aiming right at the heart of my theme. Judge thus of the stern severity of my virtue. There is no heroism in denying ourselves the pleasure which we cannot compass. It is not self-sacrifice, but self-cherishing, that turns the dyspeptic alderman away from turtle-soup and the <em>p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras</em> to mush and milk. The hungry newsboy, regaling his nostrils with the scents that come up from a subterranean kitchen, does not always know whether or not he is honest, till the cook turns away for a moment, and a steaming joint is within reach of his yearning fingers. It is no credit to a weak-minded woman not to be strong-minded and write poetry. She could not if she tried; but to feed on locusts and wild honey that the soul may be in better condition to fight the truth\u2019s battles,\u2014to go with empty stomach for a clear conscience\u2019 sake,\u2014to sacrifice intellectual tastes to womanly duties, when the two conflict,\u2014<br>\u201cThat\u2019s the true pathos and sublime,<br>Of human life.\u201d</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You will, therefore, no longer withhold your appreciative admiration, when, in full possession of what theologians call the power of contrary choice, I make the unmistakable assertion that I am a woman.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is an excerpt from a recent book about the arts.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>By 1867, the year of Baudelaire\u2019s death\u2014 Queen Victoria had been on the throne for thirty years and the name \u201cVictorian\u201d had begun to be a target of some mockery\u2014playwrights, architects, composers, poets, novelists, and other makers of high culture who longed for social respectability had largely acquired what their forebears had long struggled for. There were still patches of ground, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, where artists had not yet wholly cast off the status of servant. But in Western Europe and the United States, they could make friends with, and marry into, the upper middle classes or the gentry, and make grand claims for the autonomy and the dignity of their vocation.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Their cause could only prosper from the spectacle of aristocrats like Lord Byron or the vicomte de Chateaubriand, who did not disdain writing poems or novels, and even getting paid for it. Even a few German states timidly joined this status revolution: Goethe and Schiller were raised to the nobility. That von Goethe was also a hardworking public servant in the duchy of Weimar and von Schiller a professor lecturing on the philosophy of history at the University of Jena did not exactly injure their social transfiguration. But their sober occupations were not the main reason for their elevation, which they largely owed to their literary fame.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The elbow room that aspiring avant-garde artists, like their more conventional colleagues, needed was more than mere celebrity. What they craved was an ideology, a solid validation of their lofty modern status. In 1835, toward the end of the promising early years of the French July Monarchy, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier\u2019s naughty <em>Mademoiselle de Maupin</em>, this declaration of independence in behalf of literature, proved an impressive statement. Gautier, all of twenty-three, prefaced the novel with a long, racy manifesto, which championed what would come to be called, tersely, \u201cart for art\u2019s sake.\u201d In view of its historic import and its place in the career of modernism, it should really be called \u201cart for artists\u2019 sake,\u201d for it was a strong plea for the maker of beautiful objects as much as an appreciation of the objects themselves. It rejected the classic division between the two, which had long separated art (highly admired) from the artist (socially disdained).</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Art, so this modern doctrine goes, serves no one but itself\u2014not mammon, not God, not country, not bourgeois self-glorification, certainly not moral progress. It boasts its own techniques and standards, its own ideals and gratifications. \u201cI don\u2019t know who said it, I don\u2019t know where,\u201d Gautier wrote, \u201cthat literature and the arts influence morality. Whoever he was, he was doubtless a great fool.\u201d All that the arts produce is beauty, and \u201cnothing that is beautiful is indispensable to life.\u201d The good looks of women, the charms of music and painting, are valuable to the extent that they are useless. \u201cNothing is truly beautiful but what can never be of use to anything. Everything that is useful is ugly, for it is the expression of some need, and human needs are ignoble and disgusting, like men\u2019s own poor and feeble nature. The most useful place in a home is the latrine.\u201d Nothing could be plainer.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Art for art\u2019s sake was in fact too direct a proposition for many advanced writers or painters to support it wholeheartedly. And yet\u2014which is why the doctrine had broader impact than its limited explicit popularity would have indicated\u2014anti-bourgeois, anti-academic artists were only too pleased to exploit its implications without fully subscribing to its principles. Cultural pessimists all the way back to Plato had believed that the wrong kind of poetry or the wrong kind of music have pernicious effects on morals; at the other extreme, believers in the innate goodness of human nature found it hard to abandon the hope that the right kind of poetry or music would purify conduct. Many modernist heretics retained some of the old faith that painting, the drama, the novel have a moral mission, whichever side an artist was on\u2014for every Joyce or Schoenberg, creating for his own sake, there was a Strindberg or an Eliot working under the pressure of powerful social and religious convictions. In effect, art for art\u2019s sake was a radical assertion in behalf of nineteenth-century artworks, as well as of their makers\u2019 claim to sovereignty: the artist is responsible to no one but himself, and herself, except perhaps to other artists.</p>",

Of the numbers who study, or at least who read history, how few derive any advantage from their labours! The heroes of history are so decked out by the fine fancy of the professed historian; they talk in such measured prose, and act from such sublime or such diabolical motives, that few have sufficient taste, wickedness, or heroism, to sympathise in their fate. Besides, there is much uncertainty even in the best authenticated ancient or modern histories; and that love of truth, which in some minds is innate and immutable, necessarily leads to a love of secret memoirs, and private anecdotes. We cannot judge either of the feelings or of the characters of men with perfect accuracy, from their actions or their appearance in public; it is from their careless conversations, their half-finished sentences, that we may hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real characters. The life of a great or of a little man written by himself, the familiar letters, the diary of any individual published by his friends or by his enemies, after his decease, are esteemed important literary curiosities. We are surely justified, in this eager desire, to collect the most minute facts relative to the domestic lives, not only of the great and good, but even of the worthless and insignificant, since it is only by a comparison of their actual happiness or misery in the privacy of domestic life that we can form a just estimate of the real reward of virtue, or the real punishment of vice. That the great are not as happy as they seem, that the external circumstances of fortune and rank do not constitute felicity, is asserted by every moralist: the historian can seldom, consistently with his dignity, pause to illustrate this truth: it is therefore to the biographer we must have recourse. After we have beheld splendid characters playing their parts on the great theatre of the world, with all the advantages of stage effect and decoration, we anxiously beg to be admitted behind the scenes, that we may take a nearer view of the actors and actresses.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Some may perhaps imagine, that the value of biography depends upon the judgment and taste of the biographer: but on the contrary it may be maintained, that the merits of a biographer are inversely as the extent of his intellectual powers and of his literary talents. A plain unvarnished tale is preferable to the most highly ornamented narrative. Where we see that a man has the power, we may naturally suspect that he has the will to deceive us; and those who are used to literary manufacture know how much is often sacrificed to the rounding of a period, or the pointing of an antithesis.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That the ignorant may have their prejudices as well as the learned cannot be disputed; but we see and despise vulgar errors: we never bow to the authority of him who has no great name to sanction his absurdities. The partiality which blinds a biographer to the defects of his hero, in proportion as it is gross, ceases to be dangerous; but if it be concealed by the appearance of candour, which men of great abilities best know how to assume, it endangers our judgment sometimes, and sometimes our morals. If her grace the Duchess of Newcastle<sup>1</sup>, instead of penning her lord\u2019s elaborate eulogium, had undertaken to write the life of Savage<sup>2</sup>, we should not have been in any danger of mistaking an idle, ungrateful libertine for a man of genius and virtue. The talents of a biographer are often fatal to his reader. For these reasons the public often judiciously countenance those, who, without sagacity to discriminate character, without elegance of style to relieve the tediousness of narrative, without enlargement of mind to draw any conclusions from the facts they relate, simply pour forth anecdotes, and retail conversations, with all the minute prolixity of a gossip in a country town.</p></div><hr><div><small><p><sup>1</sup>Margaret Lucas Cavendish (1624\u20131674), an English aristocrat and writer, authored \u201cThe Life of William Cavendish.\u201d<br><sup>2</sup>Richard Savage (1679\u20131743) was an English poet and dramatist.</p></div></small></div>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is excerpted from a recent book of essays.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There is something preemptive about laziness, something that smacks of a decision to refuse all offers even before they\u2019re put on the table. The lazy don\u2019t come to the table. And I think there is a philosophical component to this reluctance. At bottom, laziness is negation, turning one\u2019s back on what others neutrally, cheerfully, or resignedly go to meet. The truly lazy\u2014the ones who cannot bring themselves to greet and meet, to scheme and struggle, to interact on a daily basis with others\u2014are, in effect, refusing to affix their signatures to the social contract. Given that success hinges on understanding, using, and occasionally subverting the social contract, the lazy don\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The secret to failure is far more elusive than the secret to success. Lagging behind when one could have advanced isn\u2019t just about laziness; it\u2019s about all the things that psychoanalysis takes a rather serious view of\u2014the absence of love, coping with anger, rationalizing failure, the reluctance to supersede or replace one\u2019s father. Heavy stuff, and perhaps true, but the acknowledgment of which never put a dime in my pocket.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Laziness just is. It\u2019s like being freckled or color blind. Indeed, when the world was younger, intelligent people believed they had no choice in the matter of who was naughty or nice, passive or active. Hippocrates\u2019s theory<sup>1</sup> of \u201ctemperament,\u201d which anchored Western medicine for two millennia, put some muscle behind varieties of human behavior. Well, not muscle exactly\u2014more like four potentially pathogenic substances, or cardinal humors, whose relative proportion in the blood determined personality and moods. The Church fathers, as it turns out, were on the right track; only the messenger and manner of delivery were wrong. It\u2019s not black bile or phlegm that causes Oblomov-like<sup>2</sup> symptoms but a certain kind of electrochemical activity in the left frontal lobe of the brain, or whatever. The point is, everyone enters the world predisposed physiologically to think and feel in certain ways.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Happenstance also has its place; I don\u2019t deny that. But do any two people react identically to the same stimuli? The event that jump-starts one person\u2019s psyche does not necessarily have the same effect on another\u2019s. It\u2019s one thing to concede that certain tendencies can be reinforced or weakened by experience; it is quite another to think that some event during my formative years, which might have occurred but didn\u2019t, would have had me sharing a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken with Bill Gates, or loping down a runway in Milan wearing a spiffy outfit by Valentino. In short, there\u2019s no contradiction in thinking that temperament defines you and thinking that you\u2019re still in charge of your life. Temperament is the gas, but you\u2019ve got a foot on the pedal.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Because of some unpredictable sequence of recombinant DNA and early experiences, I always knew I\u2019d write things. I also knew I was an incurable lazybones. This accounts, in my case, for the odd tension between writing and laziness, which Samuel Beckett describes to a T: \u201cThere is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express.\u201d As a solid constituent of the couchant<sup>3</sup> class, I can say that the obligation to express does not weigh heavily. Still, I have my moments\u2014moments when I feel like addressing the fading shimmer of my own skin. I want answers. Or, more precisely, one big answer. In a sense, life is like an examination that has only one question\u2014the one that asks why you\u2019re taking the exam in the first place. Having been instructed to \u201cfill in the blank\u201d (an aptly phrased command), you ponder, and then wonder if perhaps the truest answer is no answer at all. But in the end, because there is, after all, plenty of time to reflect and you do want to leave the room, you hunker down and fill in the blank. My own response is hardly profound or incisive: I\u2019m taking the exam because I like writing sentences, and because\u2014well, what else do I have to do?</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As for the laziness that moves with me wherever I go, I have finally found a way to make it \u201cwork\u201d for me. Lassitude, aloofness, low-grade depression, coupled with a healthy respect for money, have gradually steered me to the obvious vocation. Yes, dear reader, I have become a screenwriter.</p><hr><small><p><span><sup>1</sup> Hippocrates was an ancient G reek physician who b elieved that bodily fluids, or humors, influenced human health and disposition.</span><br><span><sup>2</sup> Oblomov is a nobleman in a nineteenth-century Russian novel who is famous for his lethargy and inertia.</span><br><span><sup>3</sup> lying on the belly with the head raised, like a heraldic lion on a coat of arms</span></p></small></p>",

A successful publisher and consummate networker with an inventive curiosity, he would have felt right at home in the information revolution, and his unabashed striving to be part of an upwardly mobile meritocracy made him, in social critic David Brooks's phrase, \"our founding Yuppie.\" We can easily imagine having a beer with him after work, showing him how to use the latest digital device, sharing the business plan for a new venture, and discussing the most recent political scandals or policy ideas. He would laugh at the latest joke \u2026 We would admire both his earnestness and his self-aware irony. And we would relate to the way he tried to balance, sometimes uneasily, the pursuit of reputation, wealth, earthly virtues, and spiritual values.<sup>1</sup></p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Some who see the reflection of Franklin in the world today fret about a shallowness of soul and a spiritual complacency that seem to permeate a culture of materialism. They say that he teaches us how to live a practical and pecuniary life, but not an exalted existence. Others see the same reflection and admire the basic middle-class values and democratic sentiments that now seem under assault from elitists, radicals, reactionaries, and other bashers of the bourgeoisie. They regard Franklin as an exemplar of the personal character and civic virtue that are too often missing in modern America.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Much of the admiration is warranted, and so too are some of the qualms. But the lessons from Franklin's life are more complex than those usually drawn by either his fans or his foes.

The word \"meritocracy\" is an argument-starter, and I have employed it sparingly in this book. It is often used loosely to denote a vision of social mobility based on merit and diligence, like Franklin's. The word was coined by British social thinker Michael Young (later to become somewhat ironically, Lord Young of Darlington) in his 1958 book <em>The Rise of Meritocracy</em> (New York: Viking Press) as a dismissive term to satirize a society that misguidedly created a new elite class based on the \"narrow band of values\" of IQ and educational credentials. The Harvard philosopher John Rawls, in <em>A Theory of Justice</em> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1971), 106, used it more broadly to mean a \"social order [that] follows the principle of careers open to talents.\"</p></small>",

In addition to school essays, there were poems written to order for family celebrations as well as word games, like writing nonsense verses in alternate lines, all of which required verbal facility. These circumstances were of singular importance for women.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>By the late nineteenth century, diary and letter writing had become predominantly female arts. If women did not monopolize them, they were thought to have special talents or responsibilities for their performance. Once a common spiritual exercise for both sexes, diary keeping had evolved into something of a calling for female adolescents of the comfortable classes. Often presented by parents as gifts to girls in their early teens, diaries were sanctioned as a technique for promoting discipline and character, a practice that might aid in the transition from sometimes ornery adolescence to more pliant womanhood. In their pages, girls recorded, sometimes painfully, their struggles to \u201cbe good,\u201d to settle gnawing religious doubts, to subdue their pride or resentment at parental authority. Whatever the intent of adults, by fostering exploration of inner lives, diaries often promoted self-reflection of an individualistic sort in ways that allowed for a more assertive female subjectivity. In their (presumably) secret pages, girls could express anger and try out a variety of identities, some of them at least mildly subversive. Perhaps critics were right to consider diaries sufficiently dangerous to warn against them, as some did in the 1870s.<sup>2</sup></p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Diaries assumed their greatest importance during adolescence, but women of all ages were often prodigious letter writers. As those charged with the emotional well-being of extended as well as nuclear families, women kept in touch with absent members and distant relatives. The pattern began in youth: boys might be expected to write letters, but their lapses were more readily tolerated than those of their sisters. In a mobile society that detached people from their points of origin, women's letters often constituted the primary means of communication between family members. As the principal letter writers, women not only demonstrated their vaunted verbal facility but gained authority in negotiating family matters.<sup>3</sup></p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Diary keeping and letter writing originated in gendered obligations. But they were often so much more. In addition to any personal satisfaction they brought, these genres enhanced powers of observation and self-reflection. Self-conscious about their letters, which they knew would be read aloud or passed around among family members, young women labored over their literary productions. Observant correspondents like Alice Hamilton became vivid storytellers who set their scenes with care, created characters out of themselves and the people they met, and adjusted their narratives to fit their intended audience.<sup>4</sup> Earlier in the century, in just this manner, letter writing proved to be an important training ground for Harriet Beecher Stowe, who incorporated techniques she had perfected in her correspondence into her domestic fiction.<sup>5</sup> In creating themselves in and through their diaries and letters (that is, both for themselves and for others), women often drew on models available to them from literature. In this way reading and writing converged.</p><hr/><small><p><span><sup>1 </sup>For an admirably thorough and wide-ranging study of literary practices in everyday life that draws on a vast array of archival sources for an earlier period, see Ronald J.

        "text": "<p><em>(The passage below consists of excerpts from an essay published in the 1940s.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is the fate of actors to leave only picture postcards behind them. Every night when the curtain goes down the beautiful coloured canvas is rubbed out. What Line remains is at best only a wavering, insubstantial phantom\u2014a verbal life on the lips of the living. Ellen Terry was well aware of it. She tried herself, overcome by the greatness of Irving as Hamlet and indignant at the caricatures of his detractors, to describe what she remembered. It was in vain. She dropped her pen in despair. \u201cOh God, that I were a writer!\u201d she cried. \u201cSurely a <em>writer </em>could not string words together about Henry Irving\u2019s Hamlet and say <em>nothing, nothing.</em>\u201d It never struck her, humble as she was, and obsessed by her lack of book learning, that she was, among other things, a writer. It never occurred to her when she wrote her autobiography, or scribbled page after page to Bernard Shaw late at night, dead tired after a rehearsal, that she was \u201cwriting.\u201d The words in her beautiful rapid hand bubbled off her pen. With dashes and notes of exclamation she tried to give them the very tone and stress of the spoken word. It is true, she could not build a house with words, one room opening out of another, and a staircase connecting the whole. But whatever she took up became in her warm, sensitive grasp a tool. If it was a rolling-pin, she made perfect pastry. If it was a carving knife, perfect slices fell from the leg of mutton. If it were a pen, words peeled off, some broken, some suspended in mid-air, but all far more expressive than the tappings of the professional typewriter.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>With her pen then at odds and ends of time she has painted a self-portrait. It is not an Academy portrait, glazed, framed, complete. It is rather a bundle of loose leaves upon each of which she has dashed off a sketch for a portrait\u2014here a nose, here an arm, here a foot, and there a mere scribble in the margin. The sketches done in different moods, from different angles, sometimes contradict each other.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Which, then, of all these women is the real Ellen Terry? How are we to put the scattered sketches together? Is she mother, wife, cook, critic, actress, or should she have been, after all, a painter? Each part seems the right part until she throws it aside and plays another. Something of Ellen Terry it seems overflowed every part and remained unacted. Shakespeare could not fit her; not Ibsen; nor Shaw. The stage could not hold her; nor the nursery. But there is, after all, a greater dramatist than Shakespeare, Ibsen, or Shaw. There is Nature. Hers is so vast a stage, and so innumerable a company of actors, that for the most part she fobs them off with a tag or two. They come on and they go off without breaking the ranks. But now and again Nature creates a new part, an original part. The actors who act that part always defy our attempts to name them. They will not act the stock parts\u2014they forget the words, they improvise others of their own. But when they come on the stage falls like a pack of cards and the limelights are extinguished. That was Ellen Terry\u2019s fate\u2014to act a new part. And thus while other actors are remembered because they were Hamlet, Ph\u00e8dre, or Cleopatra, Ellen Terry is remembered because she was Ellen Terry.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The passage below is from a book by a nineteenth-century British writer.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I suppose none of us will doubt that everything possible should be done to improve the quality of the mind of every human being. \u2014 If it is said that the female brain is incapable of studies of an abstract nature, \u2014 that is not true: for there are many instances of women who have been good mathematicians, and good classical scholars. The plea is indeed nonsense on the face of it; for the brain which will learn French will learn Greek; the brain which enjoys arithmetic is capable of mathematics. \u2014If it is said that women are light-minded and superficial, the obvious answer is that their minds should be the more carefully sobered by grave studies, and the acquisition of exact knowledge. \u2014If it is said that their vocation in life does not require these kinds of knowledge, \u2014 that is giving up the main plea for the pursuit of them by boys; \u2014 that it improves the quality of their minds. \u2014 If it is said that such studies unfit women for their proper occupations, \u2014 that again is untrue. Men do not attend the less to their professional business, their counting-house or their shop, for having their minds enlarged and enriched, and their faculties strengthened by sound and various knowledge; nor do women on that account neglect the work-basket, the market, the dairy and the kitchen. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If it be true that women are made for these domestic occupations, then of course they will be fond of them. They will be so fond of what comes most naturally to them that no book-study (if really not congenial to their minds) will draw them off from their homely duties. For my part, I have no hesitation whatever in saying that the most ignorant women I have known have been the worst housekeepers; and that the most learned women I have known have been among the best, \u2014 wherever they have been early taught and trained to household business, as every woman ought to be. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A woman of superior mind knows better than an ignorant one what to require of her servants, how to deal with tradespeople, and how to economise time: she is more clear-sighted about the best ways of doing things; has a richer mind with which to animate all about her, and to solace her own spirit in the midst of her labours. If nobody doubts the difference in pleasantness of having to do with a silly and narrow-minded woman and with one who is intelligent and enlightened, it must be clear that the more intelligence and enlightenment there is, the better. </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>One of the best housekeepers I know, \u2014 a simple-minded, affectionate-hearted woman, whose table is always fit for a prince to sit down to, whose house is always neat and elegant, and whose small income yields the greatest amount of comfort, is one of the most learned women ever heard of. When she was a little girl, she was sitting sewing in the window-seat while her brother was receiving his first lesson in mathematics from his tutor. She listened, and was delighted with what she heard; and when both left the room, she seized upon the Euclid that lay on the table, ran up to her room, went over the lesson, and laid the volume where it was before. Every day after this, she sat stitching away and listening, in like manner, and going over the lesson afterwards, till one day she let out the secret. Her brother could not answer a question which was put to him two or three times; and, without thinking of anything else, she popped out the answer. The tutor was surprised, and after she had told the simple truth, she was permitted to make what she could of Euclid. Some time after, she spoke confidentially to a friend of the family, \u2014 a scientific professor, \u2014 asking him, with much hesitation and many blushes, whether he thought it was wrong for a woman to learn Latin. </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d he said; \u201cprovided she does not neglect any duty for it. \u2014 But why do you want to learn Latin?\u201d </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>She wanted to study Newton\u2019s <em>Principia</em>: and the professor thought this a very good reason. Before she was grown into a woman, she had mastered the <em>Principia </em>of Newton. And now, the great globe on which we live is to her a book in which she reads the choice secrets of nature; and to her the last known wonders of the sky are disclosed: and if there is a home more graced with accomplishments, and more filled with comforts, I do not know such an one. </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Will anybody say that this woman would have been in any way better without her learning? \u2014 while we may confidently say that she would have been much less happy.</p>",

        "text": "<div><div><p><strong>The passage below is a draft</strong></p><p>(1) The history of music until about 200 A.D. is shrouded in darkness because there is virtually no extant music and little was written about it by the ancients. (2) The journey that jazz has taken can be traced with reasonable accuracy. (3) That it ripened most fully in New Orleans seems beyond dispute, although there are a few misguided deviants who support other theories of its origin. (4) Even before jazz, for most New Orleanians, music wasn\u2019t a luxury as it often is elsewhere. (5) It was a necessity. (6) Throughout the nineteenth century, diverse ethnic and racial groups\u2014French, Spanish, and African, Italian, German, and Irish\u2014found common cause in their love of music. (7) European folk and African-Caribbean elements merged with a popular American mainstream, causing a cultural revolution that spread far and wide.</p><p>(8) Just after the beginning of the new century, jazz began to emerge as part of a broad musical revolution. (9) It encompassed ragtime, blues, spirituals, marches, and the popular fare of \u201cTin Pan Alley.\u201d (10) It also reflected the profound contributions of people of African heritage to this new and distinctly American music. (11) Clearly, the need for an audience was obvious for it to succeed. (12) Then, of course, there was talent for the production of it\u2014also essential, too. (13) Moreover, success was required for there to be a favorable audience to receive and support it.</p><p>(14) Before long the local urge for musical expression was powerful. (15) Anything that could be twanged, strummed, beaten, blown, or stroked was likely to be exploited for its musical usefulness. (16) For a long time the washboard was a highly respected percussion instrument, and the nimble fingers of Baby Dodds and others showed sheer genius on that workaday, washday utensil. (17) What\u2019s more, dancing had long been a mainstay of New Orleans nightlife, and jazz performers gave dancers what they wanted. (18) During earlier decades, string bands, led by violinists, had co-managed dance work. (19) They offered waltzes, quadrilles, and polkas to a polite dancing public. (20) Around 1895, however, jazz pioneers Buddy Bolden and Bunk Johnson arrived on the scene. (21) They blew their cornets in the street and in funeral parades. (22) From there it was a small step to take their music into the dance halls and clubs of their uncommonly vital city.</p><p>(23) The early development of jazz in New Orleans was also connected to the community life of the city, as seen in brass band funerals, music for picnics in parks or ball games, Saturday night fish fries, and Sunday camping along the shores of Lake Ponchartrain. (24) There were also red-beans-and-rice banquets on Mondays and nightly dances at neighborhoods all over town. (25) This spirit or emotional content connected the performer to the audience. (26) It offered a musical communication in which all parties could participate.</p><p>(27) By the turn of the twentieth century, instrumentation borrowed from both brass marching bands and string bands was predominant. (28) It consisted of a front line of cornet, clarinet, and trombone, and with a rhythm section of guitar, bass, and drums. (29) Dance audiences, especially the younger ones, however, craved more excitement. (30) Gradually, the emergence of ragtime, blues and, later, jazz began to satisfy the demand. (31) Musicians began to redefine roles, moving away from sight-reading toward playing by ear. (32) The 1890s represented the culmination of a century of music making in the city and around the country.</p><p>(33) Stories of the twenties in Chicago and elsewhere are almost too familiar to need repeating here. (34) What seems pertinent is to observe that jazz gravitated toward a particular kind of environment in which its existence was not only possible but, seen in retrospect, probable. (35) On the south side of Chicago during the twenties the New Orleans music continued an unbroken development. (36) It is not by coincidence that the decade of the 1920s has come to be known as \u201cThe Jazz Age.\u201d (37) This was the time when jazz became fashionable, as part of the youthful revolution in morals and manners that come with the \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d following World War I.</p><p>(38) Americans were now more urbanized, affluent and entertainmentoriented than ever before. (39) The music industry was quick to take advantage of the situation. (40) In 1921, 100 million phonograph records were produced in the United States (compared to 25 million in 1914). (41) Two years later production remained high at 92 million, setting a trend which continued for the better part of the decade (until the impact of radio). (42) This prosperity relied heavily on the demand of records for dancers. (43) They could be used at home for practicing the latest steps, including such exotic dances as the Shimmy, the Charleston, and the more utilitarian Fox Trot, also known as \u201cthe businessman\u2019s bounce.\u201d</p></div></div>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>[...]In reader surveys, it is discovered again and again that men who read, read other men, almost exclusively, and that women who read, while favoring women writers, read across gender far more equitably. The ways in which books are packaged, marketed and publicised reflect this reality. As the VIDA Count shows, in most cultural media, men\u2019s writing is given far more cultural weight than writing by women\u2014more bylines, more publication, more reviews. And for all the othered others, there is even less cultural room to exist. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What does it mean to read only books by men, and for the most part\u2014and let\u2019s face it, much of the time exclusively\u2014white men? It means, in part, that the reader participates in the idea, which runs, invisible and toxic, through our culture, that the default human is male. And, so often partnered with this, that maleness is unitary, obvious and unchallengeable in other ways, encompassing the hallucinations and actualities of race, sexuality, and class. What happens when readers don\u2019t push into the prevailing wind, don\u2019t strain against the tide? What happens when, as readers, we do not travel across the structures and the lines of the obvious and the given, seeking out the openings, the intersections? We get what is served and consider it freely chosen. We might experience cultureas nature, as fundamentally unchanging and unchangeable. And, most of all, we might turn away from each other. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Men reading only, or largely, male writers often do so as an unreflected-upon exercise of taste; thinking, it seems, that they are not missing much. But they are imposing upon themselves an enormous loss of connection with half and more of humanity and rejecting an immense gain of vision and understanding in a dazzlingly expanded universe of books. There are significant insights to be gained from considering all genders\u2019 writing as existing in one republic of letters. Where the male writer is\u2014or claims to be\u2014unaware of the debt he owes to his female antecedents, nonetheless male artistic choices are drawn from a culture that is alive with the literary and artistic achievements of women. Critics should not boost male writers by simply placing them on the giants\u2019 shoulders of their greatest male predecessors as they plot credible lineages. Criticism would be revitalized by a broader, more complex and fairer understanding of influence. </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When a person sits down to write, they have a body, they have memory, they have their entire somatic functioning and everything that is embedded there. Writing is a practice where a singular means is drawn out of all that stuff and shaped into something that can be shared with a few or many people, or with no one but the self who writes. People write out of their skin and their memory and their blood, out of history and culture, out of every hour they have lived, out of everything that they have read, everything that they have not read, everything they have heard and misheard: the reserves of their entire sensory experience. All that is felt and thought and all that resides deep inside them beyond thought. There are an almost infinite number of connections that a writer can make with this, and if they can make those in language, and are not lost costively within themselves, then they are writing.

(2) In the test, researchers surreptitiously place a mark on a subject\u2019s body and then place the subject before a mirror. (3) If the subject tries to touch or remove the mark, then he or she must be self-aware. (4) Gallup originally tested chimpanzees (which passed), but other species, mostly other primates, have also recognized themselves in the mirror. (5) Subsequently, humans typically pass the test starting at around 18 months of age.</p><p>(6) These studies have supported the long-held belief that only the most intelligent creatures are capable of recognizing the self. (7) But a recent study in which a tiny tropical fish seemingly passed the mirror test is turning that assumption on its head, suggesting that self-awareness is more widespread throughout the animal kingdom than previously thought.</p><p>(8) Researchers in Japan decided to test the bluestreak cleaner wrasse because of its strong eyesight and its habit of eating parasites off other, larger fish. (9) The researchers presumed the fish were intelligent, yet even they were surprised by the study\u2019s results. (10) The territorial wrasses at first reacted aggressively when presented with a mirror in their tank, but over time they developed erratic behavior: dancing and bobbing in front of the mirror, sometimes upside down. (11) When researchers placed a colorful gel on the fish\u2019s throat, a spot they could see only in the mirror, the wrasses spent a lot of time examining the mark and even tried to scrape it off.</p><p>(12) Redouan Bshary offered his opinions on the study: \u201cI never saw a cleaner swimming on its back, and I never saw a cleaner scratching its throat. (13) These are new behaviors that are apparently tightly linked to the mirror.\u201d (14) While the study has not yet been peer-reviewed, it is already sparking debate, with some scientists citing it as proof that fish are more clever than commonly thought\u2014and may even belong in the exclusive club of self-aware animals, previously dominated by primates.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Moves to block cultivation of genetically modified crops in the developing world can no longer be tolerated on ethical or moral grounds, the government\u2019s chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, has warned. He said the world faced \u201ca perfect storm\u201d of issues that could lead to widespread food shortages and public unrest over the next few decades. His warning comes in the wake of food riots in north Africa and rising global concern about mounting food prices.   </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cA number of very important factors are about to change our world,\u201d said Beddington, an expert in population biology. \u201cIts population is rising by six million every month and will reach a total of around 9,000 million by 2050. At the same time, it is estimated that by 2030 more than 60% of the population will be living in cities and will no longer be involved in growing crops or raising domestic animals. And on top of that the world\u2019s population is getting more prosperous and able to pay for more food.\u201d . . .   </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Beddington said humanity had to face the fact that every means to improve food production should now be employed, including widespread use of new biotechnological techniques in farming. He stressed that no harm should be inflicted on humans or the environment. His remarks were made in advance of publication tomorrow of a major report, \u201cThe Future of Food and Farming.\u201d . . .   </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>He emphasised the role of modern biotechnological techniques, including GM crops, in the future of global food production. \u201cThere will be no silver bullet, but it is very hard to see how it would be remotely sensible to justify not using new technologies such as GM. Just look at the problems that the world faces: water shortages and salination of existing water supplies, for example. GM crops should be able to deal with that.\u201d   </p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Such remarks will enrage many environmental groups, who believe it is wrong for the west to impose a technology it has developed on the third world. But Beddington was adamant about the benefits of GM crop technology. \u201cAround 30% of food is lost before it can be harvested because it is eaten by pests that we never learnt how to control. We cannot afford that kind of loss to continue. GM should be able to solve that problem by creating pest-resistant strains, for example. Of course, we will have to make sure these crops are properly tested; that they work; that they don\u2019t harm people; and that they don\u2019t harm the environment.\u201d   </p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>GM crops alone would not be sufficient to hold off widespread starvation, he added. No single approach would guarantee food security for humanity for the rest of the century. A widespread approach, including the development of proper sustainability, protecting fish stocks and changes to patterns of consumption, was also critical, he said. \u201cThis report was set up to find out if we can feed nine billion people sustainably, healthily and equitably. We can, but it will take many different approaches to crack the problem.\u201d   </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Almost a billion people now suffer serious food shortages and face starvation. \u201cIt is unimaginable that in the next 10 to 20 years that there will not be a worsening of that problem unless we take action now, and we have to include the widest possible range of solutions.\u201d</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The passage below is excerpted from an essay published in the early twentieth century.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Every child has to learn the language he is born to. It is certain that he will make mistakes in the process, especially as he is not taught it by any wise system, but blunders into what usage he can grasp from day to day. Now, if an adult foreigner were learning our language, and we greeted his efforts with yells of laughter, we should think ourselves grossly rude. And what should we think of ourselves if we further misled him by setting absurd words and phrases before him, encouraging him to further blunders, that we might laugh the more; and then, if we had visitors, inciting him to make these blunders over again to entertain the company? Yet this is common household sport, so long as there is a little child to act as zany for the amusement of his elders. The errors of a child are not legitimate grounds of humour, even to those coarse enough to laugh at them, any more than a toddling baby\u2019s falls have the same elements of the incongruous as the overthrow of a stout old gentleman who sits down astonished in the snow. A baby has to fall. It is natural, and not funny. So does the young child have to make mistakes as he learns any or all of the crowding tasks before him; but these are not fair grounds for ridicule.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I was walking in a friend\u2019s garden, and met for the first time the daughter of the house, a tall, beautiful girl of nineteen or twenty. Her aunt, who was with me, cried out to her in an affected tone, \u201cCome and meet the lady, Janey!\u201d The young girl, who was evidently unpleasantly impressed, looked annoyed, and turned aside in some confusion, speaking softly to her teacher who was with her. Then the aunt, who was a very muscular woman, seized the young lady by her shoulders, lifted her off the ground, and thrust her blushing, struggling, and protesting into my arms\u2014by way of introduction! Naturally enough, the girl was overcome with mortification, and conceived a violent dislike for me. (This story is exactly true, except that the daughter of the house was aged two and a half.)</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Now why,\u2014in the name of reason, courtesy, education, justice, any lofty and noble consideration,\u2014why should Two-and-a-half be thus insulted? What is the point of view of the insulter? How does she justify her brutal behaviour? Is it on the obvious ground of physical superiority in age and strength? It cannot be that, for we do not gratuitously outrage the feelings of all persons younger and smaller than ourselves. A stalwart six-foot septuagenarian does not thus comport himself toward a small gentleman of thirty or forty. It cannot be relationship; for such conduct does not obtain among adults, be they never so closely allied. It has no basis except that the victim is a child, and the child has no personal rights which we feel bound to respect.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A baby, when \u201cgood,\u201d is considered as a first-rate plaything,\u2014a toy to play with or to play on or to set going like a machine-top, that we may laugh at it. There is a legitimate frolicking with small children, as the cat plays with her kittens; but that is not in the least inconsistent with respect. Grown people can play together and laugh together without jeering at each other. So we might laugh with our children, even more than we do, and yet never laugh at them. The pathetic side of it is that children are even more sensitive to ridicule than grown people. They have no philosophy to fall back upon; and,\u2014here is the hideously unjust side,\u2014if they lose their tempers, being yet unlearned in self-restraint,\u2014if they try to turn the tables on their tormentors, then the wise \u201cgrown-up\u201d promptly punishes them for \u201cdisrespect.\u201d They must respect their elders even in this pitiful attitude; but who is to demand the respect due to youth?</p>",

        "text": "<p><i>(This passage from a contemporary American nonfiction book was written by Margot Lee Shetterly and first published in 2016.)</i></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Mary Jackson scrutinized every aspect of the model\u2014its smoothness, its symmetry and alignment, its weight distribution\u2014her trained eye and intuition sensitive to anything that might lower its aerodynamic fitness. This had been a project of nights and weekends, but she knew this investigation would provide results much more quickly than any research currently underway in the Four-foot Supersonic Tunnel<sup>1</sup>. The bar had been set the year before by an engineer in the Aerospace Mechanics Division\u2014Katherine Johnson\u2019s<sup>2</sup> group\u2014but Mary and her young collaborator were more than up to the challenge. She was ready to spend all the time it took to help her son, Levi, build a humdinger of a car to race in the peninsula\u2019s 1960 soap box derby<sup>3</sup>.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Since the beginning of the year, Mary had spent hours, hundreds of them, perhaps, collaborating with her thirteen-year-old son the way she worked with Kazimierz Czarnecki<sup>4</sup>. She and Levi had gone to the local Chevrolet dealer to fill out the entry form and pick up a copy of the official rules, which read like a familiarization manual for an airplane. \u201cThe car and driver together must weigh less than 250 pounds. Only rubber wheels allowed. Length shall not exceed 80 inches. Road clearance must be at least three inches with the driver in the car. The total cost of the car shall not exceed $10.00, exclusive of wheels and axles.\u201d They absorbed the restrictions and made sketches and measurements, trying out different designs until they settled on the best specification. Then they hunted for the materials that would bring their sketch to life. Buried in the clutter at the back of the garage might be a treasure in disguise: vegetable crates, plywood, orphaned wagon wheels, garden tools, old shoes, wire and twine\u2014just about anything could prove useful to building the car, given enough creativity. Gluing, nailing, screwing, and fitting ensued as the big race, held annually over the July Fourth holiday weekend, approached. Mary helped her son refine the vehicle until they possessed something that could roll down the street with its pilot, as the racers were known, in the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The final step was to smooth, sand, and polish the body of the car to within an inch of its home-built life. All the derby\u2019s matches started at the top of a hill, with no pushing allowed. Levi and his competitors would set off from the Twenty-Fifth Street Bridge in Newport News, virtually the only thing that could pass as a hill in the flat-as-a-pancake coastal terrain. As the pilots released their brakes, they hunched themselves as far down as they could into their vehicle\u2019s cockpit, imploring the gods of gravity to pull them as quickly as possible down the nine-hundred-foot racecourse, hoping to do righteous battle against air resistance, which was as much the foe of the pee-wee racer as it had been for Chuck Yeager<sup>5</sup>. No one knew that better than Levi\u2019s technical consultant, who managed to sneak in the occasional sponsored moment about the wonders of a career in the sciences in the midst of the building fun.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>An enduring symbol of American boyhood (girls weren\u2019t allowed to race until the early 1970s), the All-American Soap Box Derby<sup>6</sup> mixed good old American whiz-bang ingenuity with family fun. The competition had started as a Depression-era distraction, a way to create something out of nothing when nothing was what most people had. Over the years, it had taken hold at the grassroots, and in 1960 Levi was one of fifty thousand boys gearing up to compete in local races around the country. Not surprisingly, the peninsula embraced the competition with zeal. Parents who spent their days designing, building, fixing, and operating machines of transportation signed their sons up and gave free rein to their own tinkering instincts. They got to spend time with their children and let the parental mask slip just a bit, giving their offspring a glimpse of the curious child they themselves had once been. Officially, the derby was the boy\u2019s show, from building the car to crouching inside it on race day. Parents (usually fathers; Mary was one of the very rare derby moms) were supposed to stand back and offer only advice, but it was usually hard to tell who savored the engineering project more, the parent or the child.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Like craftsmen in a medieval guild, the NASA engineers hoped that one day their children would decide to take up the mantle of the profession they held so dear. Their workplace was pleasant and safe, their colleagues were smart and interesting, and over the course of the twentieth century, engineers had seen the fruits of their labor transform every aspect of modern life in ways that seemed unimaginable even as they were happening. They wouldn\u2019t get rich, but an engineer\u2019s salary was more than enough to crack into the ranks of the comfortable middle class. So they served as laboratory assistants for science projects and turned the kitchen table into an honors calculus class. They held their offspring captive until the last homework problem was solved correctly, adolescent insolence and tears be damned.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>A specialized NASA facility at Langley Research Center used for supersonic aerodynamics testing<br><sup>2</sup>An African American mathematician at NASA known for her critical calculations of orbital mechanics<br><sup>3</sup>A youth car-racing competition where participants build and race homemade, gravity-powered vehicles<br><sup>4</sup>A NASA engineer at Langley who mentored Mary Jackson<br><sup>5</sup>The first pilot to break the sound barrier in 1947<br><sup>6</sup>An annual national racing event for children, founded in the 1930s</p></small>",

        "text": "<p><i>(The following contemporary essay by an American writer was published in 2013.)</i></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Contemporary black film is not nearly as robust as it should be. When movies by a promising black writer-director like Coogler\u2019s <i>Fruitvale Station</i> premiere, black audiences wonder if finally they might enjoy a movie that is well written, acted, directed, and produced. Of course, this is the holy grail of all cinema, but it seems particularly unreachable in much of what black cinema has to offer. Broadly speaking, if contemporary black cinema were divided into categories, we\u2019d have raunchy comedies like <i>Soul Plane</i><sup>1</sup>, the feel-good family films frequented by Eddie Murphy and Ice Cube, the awareness-raising films that tackle major race-related issues, and, of course, the work of Tyler Perry. Most black movies, for better or worse, carry a burden of expectation, having to be everything to everyone because we have so little to choose from.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Suffice it to say, a movie about a notorious incident of police brutality like <i>Fruitvale Station</i> enters an already fraught conversation. On New Year\u2019s Day in 2009, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) police officer Johannes Mehserle<sup>2</sup>, working at the BART station in Oakland\u2019s heavily Latino Fruitvale district, shot Oscar Grant, a young black man returning to Oakland after celebrating with friends in San Francisco, in the back. Earlier that night, BART police had responded to reports of a fight by removing Grant and several of his friends from the train. Accounts of what happened next differ, but matters escalated quickly.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Bystanders took a number of videos and images of the incident, and soon these artifacts of Grant\u2019s death went viral. Oakland residents held a vigil and rioted, releasing a long-simmering rage over the plight of young black men in the city. Protests, some violent, would continue for more than a year. Four years later, digital traces of Grant\u2019s death linger across the Internet, continuing to bear witness.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><i>Fruitvale Station</i> begins with Oscar (Michael B. Jordan) and his girlfriend, Sophina (Melonie Diaz), talking about their New Year\u2019s resolutions. Then the film jumps to 2:15 a.m. in the nearly empty station. Oscar and a group of his friends are seated on the ground. Officers surround them, both the young men and the police shouting. The footage, from a cell phone, is shaky and grainy, but there is no ambiguity about what is taking place.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The rest of the movie chronicles the events leading up to that moment. Oscar is shown as a charming young man with a troubled past who is finally on the right path. After two stints in prison for drug dealing, he is working to reconnect with Sophina. He dotingly cares for his daughter, Tatiana, and strives to be a good son to his mother, Wanda (Octavia Spencer). A movie about limited options for young inner-city black men, <i>Fruitvale</i> also explores the multiple identities many of these men must adopt. Oscar is a master of code-switching\u2014the man he is with his mother is different from the man he is with his girlfriend and child, with his friends, or in prison. As director Coogler, who is from the Bay Area, notes, \u201cOftentimes you\u2019ve got to be different people just to stay alive.\u201d</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When Oscar picks Tatiana up from day care, they race back to the car, their bodies so full of joy it\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to outrun the feeling. Actor Michael B. Jordan, best known as Wallace, the sixteen-year-old dealer from <i>The Wire</i>, and Vince, the high school quarterback from <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, expresses that joy from his face to the kick of his heels. In scenes with Diaz, Jordan brings out the raw appeal of a young man in his prime\u2014slow drawls, sexy smiles, toned body. He also expresses openness and vulnerability when Oscar confesses to Sophina that he has lost his job and when, in prison, he begs his mother not to leave him alone.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>A 2004 American comedy known for its comedic stereotypes.<br><sup>2</sup>Former BART police officer who shot and killed Oscar Grant in 2009.</p></small>",

        "text": "<p><i>(The following essay excerpt by the British writer George Orwell was published in 1946.)</i></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing. Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions, and not a \u201cparty line.\u201d Orthodoxy, of whatever colour, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style. The political dialects to be found in pamphlets, leading articles, manifestos, White Papers and the speeches of Under-Secretaries do, of course, vary from party to party, but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid, home-made turn of speech.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases\u2014bestial atrocities, iron heel, blood-stained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder\u2014one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker\u2019s spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance towards turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is making is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate favourable to political conformity.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India<sup>1</sup>, the Russian purges<sup>2</sup> and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan<sup>3</sup>, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Consider for instance some comfortable English professor defending Russian totalitarianism. He cannot say outright, \u201cI believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so.\u201d Probably, therefore, he will say something like this: \u201cWhile freely conceding that the Soviet regime exhibits certain features which the humanitarian may be inclined to deplore, we must, I think, agree that a certain curtailment of the right to political opposition is an unavoidable concomitant of transitional periods, and that the rigours which the Russian people have been called upon to undergo have been amply justified in the sphere of concrete achievement.\u201d The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one\u2019s real and one\u2019s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as \u201ckeeping out of politics.\u201d All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to find\u2014that is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify\u2014that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years, as a result of dictatorship. But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought. A bad usage can spread by tradition and imitation, even among people who should and do know better. The debased language that I have been discussing is in some ways very convenient. Phrases like a not unjustifiable assumption, leaves much to be desired, would serve no good purpose, a consideration which we should do well to bear in mind, are a continuous temptation, a packet of aspirins always at one\u2019s elbow. Look back through this essay, and for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against. This invasion of one\u2019s mind by ready-made phrases can only be prevented if one is constantly on guard against them, and every such phrase anaesthetizes a portion of one\u2019s brain. One cannot change this all in a moment, but one can at least change one\u2019s own habits, and from time to time one can even, if one jeers loudly enough, send some worn-out and useless phrase into the dustbin where it belongs.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>The period of British colonial administration in the Indian subcontinent (1858\u20131947)<br><sup>2</sup>A campaign of political repression in the Soviet Union, particularly from 1936 to 1938 under Joseph Stalin<br><sup>3</sup>The United States dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending World War II in the Pacific</p></small>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is excerpted from a 1940 autobiographical essay.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A man in the European sixteenth century was born not simply in the valley of the Thames or Seine, but in a certain social class and the environment of that class made and limited his world. He was then, consciously or not, not fully a man; he was an artisan and until he complied with the limitations of that class he was continually knocking his hands, head and heart against an environment, composed of other classes, which limited what he could and could not do and what he must do; and this greater group environment was not a matter of mere ideas and thought; it was embodied in muscles and armed men, in scowling faces, in the majesty of judge and police and in human law which became divine.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Much as I knew of this class structure of the world, I should never have realized it vividly and fully if I had not been born into its modern counterpart, racial segregation; first into a world composed of people with colored skins who remembered slavery and endured discrimination; and who had to a degree their own habits, customs, and ideals; but in addition to this I lived in an environment which I came to call the white world. I was not an American; I was not a man; I was by long education and continual compulsion and daily reminder, a colored man in a white world; and that white world often existed primarily, so far as I was concerned, to see with sleepless vigilance that I was kept within bounds. All this made me limited in physical movement and provincial in thought and dream. I could not stir. I could not act, I could not live, without taking into careful daily account the reaction of my white environing world. How I traveled and where, what work I did, what income I received, where I ate, where I slept, with whom I talked, where I sought recreation, where I studied, what I wrote and what I could get published - all this depended primarily upon an overwhelming mass of my fellow citizens in the United States, from whose society I was largely excluded.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Of course, there was no real wall between us. I knew from the days of my childhood and in the elementary school, on through my walks in the Harvard yard and my lectures in Germany, that in all things in general, white people were just the same as I: their physical possibilities, their mental processes were no different from mine; even the difference in skin color was vastly overemphasized and intrinsically trivial. And yet this fact of racial distinction based on color was the greatest thing in my life and absolutely determined it, because this surrounding group, in alliance and agreement with the white European world, was settled and determined upon the fact that I was and must be a thing apart.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was impossible to gainsay this. It was impossible for any time and to any distance to withdraw myself and look down upon those absurd assumptions with philosophical calm and humorous self-control. If, as happened to a friend of mine, a lady in a Pullman car ordered me to bring her a glass of water, mistaking me for a porter, the incident in its essence was a joke to be chuckled over; but in its hard, cruel significance and its unending inescapable sigh of slavery, it was something to drive a man mad.</p>",

        "text": "<p><i>(This passage from a contemporary nonfiction book, published in 2016, was written by an American author about the real-life women mathematicians at NASA during the early space race.)</i></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Sending a man into space was a damn tall order, but it was the part about returning him safely to Earth that kept Katherine Johnson and the rest of the space pilgrims awake at night. Each mission presented myriad pathways to disaster, starting with the notoriously temperamental Atlas rocket<sup>1</sup>, a ninety-five-foot-high, 3.5-million-horsepower intercontinental ballistic missile that had been modified to propel the Mercury capsule<sup>2</sup> into orbit. Two of the Atlas\u2019s last five sallies had ended in failure. One of them had surged into the sky before erupting into spectacular fireballs with the capsule still attached. That wasn\u2019t exactly a confidence builder for the man preparing to ride it into orbit, but it was the more powerful Atlas that would be required to accelerate the Mercury capsule to orbital velocity. The capsule itself was the most sophisticated tin can on the planet. The vehicle\u2019s oxygen and pressurization systems stood between the astronaut and the life-crushing vacuum of space. Those functions and more\u2014every switch, every indicator, every gauge\u2014had to be tested and retested for any whiff of possible failure. As the rocket blasted from the launchpad and accelerated into the sky toward maximum velocity, the aerodynamic pressure on the capsule also increased to a point known as \u201cmax Q.\u201d If the capsule wasn\u2019t strong enough to withstand the forces acting on it at max Q, it could simply explode. A Republican senator from Pennsylvania called the Mercury capsule-Atlas rocket pairing \u201ca Rube Goldberg device on top of a plumber\u2019s nightmare.\u201d</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Everything rested upon the brain busters\u2019 mastery of the laws of physics and mathematics. The mission was colossal in its scope, but it required both extreme precision and the utmost accuracy. A number transposed in calculating the launch azimuth, a significant digit too few in measuring the fully loaded weight of the capsule, a mistake in accounting for the rocket\u2019s speed and acceleration or the rotation of the Earth could cascade through the chain of dependencies, causing serious, perhaps catastrophic, consequences. So many ways to screw the pooch, and just one staggeringly complex, scrupulously modeled, endlessly rehearsed, indefatigably tested way to succeed.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Nobody, of course, understood this better than astronaut John Glenn. The former Marine test pilot had campaigned fiercely\u2014and unsuccessfully\u2014to be the first of the Mercury Seven to navigate to the heavens. Now, NASA had picked Glenn for MA-6, the orbital flight that would cast the die on the space agency\u2019s future, and he was leaving nothing to chance. He pushed himself to his physical limit, running miles each day to stay fit, tag-teaming with fellow astronaut Scott Carpenter to practice water egress from the capsule in the Back River on Langley\u2019s East Side. With the experience of Alan Shepard and Virgil Grissom as a guide, NASA physicians worried a little less about the health hazards Glenn might face while on board, since in the capsule he would be hooked up to wires like a lab rat, his every vital sign transmitted to and monitored by the doctors on the ground. The specter of human error was ever-present, of course, so Glenn worked the simulators and procedures trainers obsessively, putting himself through hundreds of simulated missions, honing his responses to every failure scenario the engineers could imagine.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As a seasoned test pilot, Glenn knew that the only way to remove all danger from the mission was to never leave Earth. The former Marine was the first pilot to average supersonic speeds in a transcontinental flight. From Project Mercury\u2019s outset, the NASA engineers had the delicate task of balancing the drive to get into space as quickly as possible with the risk they felt they could reasonably ask their human cargo to accept. Experience and analysis informed them that somewhere along this venturesome path they were certain to encounter unforeseen problems or run smack into the simple bad luck of statistics, that one time in a thousand when the worst-case scenario played out. What was within their control, however, they took pains to bulletproof, even if it meant stretching\u2014then breaking\u2014their timeline. Project Mercury\u2019s first orbital flight was originally slated to take place at the end of 1960, on President Eisenhower\u2019s watch. Additional testing and fine-tuning\u2014a cooling system bug here, an oxygen delivery glitch there, the need to implement improvements based on previous unmanned and suborbital flights\u2014conspired to push the date into the administration of incoming President Kennedy. NASA set July 1961 as the new date for the orbital flight, then rescheduled it for October, then to December. Finally the mission slipped into 1962.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>Atlas rocket: A family of American missiles and launch vehicles originally developed for the U.S. Air Force<br><sup>2</sup>Mercury capsule: The spacecraft designed to carry and protect a human passenger in NASA\u2019s Mercury program</p></small>",

This was the first speech Yousafzai gave since she had been shot by the Taliban in her home country of Pakistan.</em></p><hr><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the name of God, the most beneficent, the most merciful. Honorable UN Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki-moon, respected president of the General Assembly Vuk Jeremic, honorable UN envoy for global education Mr. Gordon Brown, respected elders and my dear brothers and sisters: Assalamu alaikum. [Peace be with you.]</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today it is an honor for me to be speaking again after a long time. Being here with such honorable people is a great moment in my life and it is an honor for me that today I am wearing a shawl of the late Benazir Bhutto. I don't know where to begin my speech. I don't know what people would be expecting me to say, but first of all thank you to God for whom we all are equal and thank you to every person who has prayed for my fast recovery and new life.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I cannot believe how much love people have shown me. I have received thousands of good wish cards and gifts from all over the world. Thank you to all of them. Thank you to the children whose innocent words encouraged me. Thank you to my elders whose prayers strengthened me. I would like to thank my nurses, doctors and the staff of the hospitals in Pakistan and the UK [United Kingdom] and the UAE [United Arab Emirates] government who have helped me to get better and recover my strength.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I fully support UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in his Global Education First Initiative and the work of UN Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown and the respectful president of the UN General Assembly Vuk Jeremic. I thank them for the leadership they continue to give. They continue to inspire all of us to action. Dear brothers and sisters, do remember one thing: Malala Day is not my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers who are not only speaking for their rights, but who are struggling to achieve their goal of peace, education and equality. Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured. I am just one of them. So here I stand. So here I stand, one girl, among many. I speak not for myself, but so those without a voice can be heard. Those who have fought for their rights. Their right to live in peace. Their right to be treated with dignity. Their right to equality of opportunity. Their right to be educated.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dear friends, on 9 October 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends, too. They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed. And out of that silence came thousands of voices. The terrorists thought they would change my aims and stop my ambitions. But nothing changed in my life except this: weakness, fear and hopelessness died. Strength, power and courage were born.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I am the same Malala. My ambitions are the same. My hopes are the same. And my dreams are the same. Dear sisters and brothers, I am not against anyone. Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. I am here to speak for the right of education for every child. I want education for the sons and daughters of the Taliban and all the terrorists and extremists. I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there was a gun in my hand and he was standing in front of me, I would not shoot him. This is the compassion I have learned from Mohammed, the prophet of mercy, Jesus Christ and Lord Buddha. This is the legacy of change I have inherited from Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and Mohammed Ali Jinnah.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is the philosophy of nonviolence that I have learned from Gandhi, Bacha Khan, and Mother Teresa. And this is the forgiveness that I have learned from my father and from my mother. This is what my soul is telling me: be peaceful and love everyone.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dear sisters and brothers, we realize the importance of light when we see darkness. We realize the importance of our voice when we are silenced. In the same way, when we were in Swat, the north of Pakistan, we realized the importance of pens and books when we saw the guns. The wise saying, \"The pen is mightier than the sword.\" It is true. The extremists are afraid of books and pens. The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them. This is why they killed 14 innocent students in the recent attack in Quetta [a city in central Pakistan]. And that is why they kill female teachers. That is why they are blasting schools every day because they were and they are afraid of change and equality that we will bring to our society. And I remember that there was a boy in our school who was asked by a journalist, \"Why are the Taliban against education?\" He answered very simply by pointing to his book. He said, \"a Talib doesn't know what is written inside this book.\"</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>They think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would point guns at people's heads just for going to school. These terrorists are misusing the name of Islam for their own personal benefit. Pakistan is a peace loving, democratic country. Pashtuns want education for their daughters and sons. Islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. It is the duty and responsibility to get education for each child, that is what it says. Peace is a necessity for education. In many parts of the world, especially Pakistan and Afghanistan, terrorism, war and conflicts stop children from going to schools. We are really tired of these wars. Women and children are suffering in many ways in many parts of the world.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In India, innocent and poor children are victims of child labor. Many schools have been destroyed in Nigeria. People in Afghanistan have been affected by extremism. Young girls have to do domestic child labor and are forced to get married at an early age. Poverty, ignorance, injustice, racism and the deprivation of basic rights are the main problems, faced by both men and women.</p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today I am focusing on women's rights and girls' education because they are suffering the most. There was a time when women activists asked men to stand up for their rights. But this time we will do it by ourselves. I am not telling men to step away from speaking for women's rights, but I am focusing on women to be independent and fight for themselves. So dear sisters and brothers, now it's time to speak up. So today, we call upon the world leaders to change their strategic policies in favor of peace and prosperity. We call upon the world leaders that all of these deals must protect women and children's rights. A deal that goes against the rights of women is unacceptable.</p><p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We call upon all governments to ensure free, compulsory education all over the world for every child. We call upon all the governments to fight against terrorism and violence. To protect children from brutality and harm. We call upon the developed nations to support the expansion of education opportunities for girls in the developing world. We call upon all communities to be tolerant, to reject prejudice based on caste, creed, sect, color, religion or agenda to ensure freedom and equality for women so they can flourish. We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave, to embrace the strength within themselves and realize their full potential.</p><p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dear brothers and sisters, we want schools and education for every child's bright future. We will continue our journey to our destination of peace and education. No one can stop us. We will speak up for our rights and we will bring change to our voice. We believe in the power and the strength of our words. Our words can change the whole world because we are all together, united for the cause of education. And if we want to achieve our goal, then let us empower ourselves with the weapon of knowledge and let us shield ourselves with unity and togetherness.</p><p><em>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dear brothers and sisters, we must not forget that millions of people are suffering from poverty and injustice and ignorance. We must not forget that millions of children are out of their schools. We must not forget that our sisters and brothers are waiting for a bright, peaceful future.</p><p><em>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So let us wage, so let us wage a glorious struggle against illiteracy, poverty and terrorism; let us pick up our books and our pens; they are the most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world. Education is the only solution. Education first. Thank you.</p></body></html>",

(2) However, cats have developed an intricate language not for each other, but for the human beings who have adopted them as pets. (3) When communicating with each other, cats\u2019 \u201ctalk\u201d is a complex system of nonverbal signals. (4) In particular, their tails, rather than any kind of \u201cspeech,\u201d provide cats\u2019 chief means of expression. (5) They also use physical contact to express their feelings. (6) With other cats, cats will use their voices only to express pain. (7) Next, incredibly, all of that changes when a human walks into the room. (8) Cats use a wide range of vocal expressions when they communicate with a person, from affectionate meows to menacing hisses. (9) Since cats\u2019 verbal expressions are not used to communicate with other cats, it is logical to conclude that cats developed this \u201clanguage\u201d expressly to communicate with their human owners. (10) This fact is demonstrated more clearly when observing households that have only one cat. (11) An only cat is usually very vocal, since the only creature around with whom the cat can communicate is its owner. (12) Cats with other feline companions, though, are much quieter. (13) If they want to have a conversation, they need only go to their fellow cats and communicate in their natural way. (14) Since cats learned to meow for the sole purpose of communicating with human beings, owners should take the time to learn what their different meows mean. (15) If an owner knows, to name just a few examples, which meow means the cat is hungry, which means the cat wants to be petted, and which means the cat wants to have a little \u201cconversation,\u201d the bond between cat and owner will grow deeper. (16) Certainly, after a time, owners will see that communicating with their pets, not just cats, is every bit as important to forging good relationships as communicating with other humans. (17) Once, as an owner, one knows that the cat is not just making senseless noises but is making an attempt to communicate, one can make an effort to communicate in return. (18) After all, a cat isn\u2019t meowing just for the sake of making noise; however, cats are less communicative than many other animals.</p>",

As the 2003 report \"The Civic Mission of Schools\" noted: \"Individuals do not automatically become free and responsible citizens, but must be educated for citizenship.\" That means civic learning\u2014educating students for democracy\u2014needs to be on par with other academic subjects.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is not a new idea. Our first public schools saw education for citizenship as a core part of their mission. Eighty years ago, John Dewey said, \"Democracy needs to be reborn in every generation and education is its midwife.\"</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But in recent years, civic learning has been pushed aside. Until the 1960s, three courses in civics and government were common in American high schools, and two of them (\"civics\" and \"problems of democracy\") explored the role of citizens and encouraged students to discuss current issues. Today those courses are very rare.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What remains is a course on \"American government\" that usually spends little time on how people can\u2014and why they should\u2014participate. The effect of reduced civic learning on civic life is not theoretical. Research shows that the better people understand our history and system of government, the more likely they are to vote and participate in the civic life.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We need more and better classes to impart the knowledge of government, history, law, and current events that students need to understand and participate in a democratic republic. And we also know that much effective civic learning takes place beyond the classroom\u2014in extracurricular activity, service work that is connected to class work, and other ways students experience civic life.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Preserving our democracy should be reason enough to promote civic learning. But there are other benefits. Understanding society and how we relate to each other fosters the attitudes essential for success in college, work, and communities; it enhances student learning in other subjects.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Economic and technological competitiveness is essential, and America's economy and technology have flourished because of the rule of law and the \"assets\" of a free and open society. Democracy has been good for business and for economic wellbeing. By the same token, failing to hone the civic tools of democracy will have economic consequences.</p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Bill Gates\u2014a top business and technology leader\u2014argues strongly that schools have to prepare students not only for college and career but for citizenship as well.</p><p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>None of this is to diminish the importance of improving math and science education. This latest push, as well as the earlier emphasis on literacy, deserves support. It should also be the occasion for a broader commitment, and that means restoring education for democracy to its central place in school.</p><p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We need more students proficient in math, science, and engineering. We also need them to be prepared for their role as citizens. Only then can self-government work. Only then will we not only be more competitive but also remain the beacon of liberty in a tumultuous world.</p>",

        "text": "<p><i>(The following excerpt from the 2014 book \"Our Declaration\" by Danielle Allen, an American political theorist, explores how the Declaration of Independence accomplishes its goals by performing actions with words.)</i></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>How exactly does the Declaration do what it does? How do the parts of the text allow it to accomplish its work? This is to ask about the structure of the Declaration. The conventional approach to the Declaration\u2019s structure is to divide it into blocks of text. For instance, one scholar writes, \u201cthe Declaration can be divided into five sections\u2014the introduction, the preamble, the indictment of George III, the denunciation of the British people, and the conclusion.\u201d But it\u2019s also possible to divide the Declaration into actions.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the first paragraph, the signers indicate that they will declare the reasons for their actions:<br><blockquote>. . . a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</blockquote></p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the second paragraph they submit facts to witnesses:<br><blockquote>The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</blockquote></p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Then, after listing the injuries done to the colonies, the Declaration formally declares independence:<br><blockquote>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, . . . do . . . solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States,</blockquote></p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Finally, the text concludes with a pledge:<br><blockquote>And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.</blockquote></p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The Declaration does what it does, then\u2014bravely giving birth to a new political entity\u2014in four concrete steps: declaring reasons, presenting facts to witnesses, declaring independence, and making pledges. These are the parts that, taken together, assembled into a word machine of sorts\u2014into a \u201cpiece of mechanism,\u201d to quote John Adams\u2019s opponent\u2014make something happen. To understand how the Declaration does what it does, we have to understand the interaction among these parts.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Declaring reasons, presenting facts, declaring that a new state of affairs obtains, and making pledges: these are familiar actions, just like what brides and grooms do when they marry. Consider. In front of witnesses, two people pledge themselves to each other, and the judge or religious official concludes the ceremony by saying, \u201cI now declare you spouses.\u201d As philosophers have shown<sup>1</sup>, what happens at a wedding can teach us a lot about language. It can also teach us a lot about the Declaration. If we follow out this metaphor, we will understand better how the actions of the Declaration fit together.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In a wedding two people walk into a temple, city hall, church, or mosque as individuals. When they say, \u201cI do,\u201d and the officiant says, \u201cI declare you spouses,\u201d real facts in the world, including legal realities, change. The couple will now be treated differently by everybody who knows them and also by officialdom. For instance, each now owns half of the other\u2019s property.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Words can be used not only to tell a story or express emotions or explain ideas but also to \u201cdo things,\u201d to bring about change in the world. Just as when a couple says, \u201cI do,\u201d the words of the Declaration make a new reality. Because these words have been uttered, the text declares, a new confederation of states now exists, and their members have pledged one another their lives, property, and honor. In this the Declaration sounds something like a wedding.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>Philosophers of language, including J. L. Austin (1911\u20131960), developed \u201cspeech act theory,\u201d showing that certain utterances perform actions rather than merely describe them.</p></small>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is excerpted from a nonfiction book published in 2018.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Although we are born into human bodies, it\u2019s our teachings\u2014and our stories\u2014that make us human. Whatever our particular gifts or limitations, no matter how our specific biology influences our decisions and behaviours, our humanity is far greater than the simple consequence of being born into the species Homo sapiens. The exchange of DNA is as much an accident of history as it is an act of will, and culture and kinship travel different (though often parallel) currents. Our biology is only a very small part of our humanity; the rest is a process of becoming.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We tend to like our metaphors, analogies, weathered old chestnuts, quick-and-easy examples, especially for this most elemental of questions. In the old \u201cnature vs. nurture\u201d debate, we might think of nature being the clay and nurture the act of sculpting. The medium of clay determines much of what can be achieved, but it\u2019s the care or negligence of the sculptor that has the greater influence. Of course, this presumes that the clay itself has no further role to play than to simply be, and it also ignores the ways that moisture, light, temperature, and other environmental conditions can affect both the process and the final result, so in the end this hackneyed metaphor, like most, falls short. Metaphors alone can\u2019t encompass what it is to be human, nor can lived experience.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For that, we need stories.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We learn to be human from everything around us, as the worlds we inhabit help to define both the limits and the possibilities of our humanity. And because the specificities of each of our experiential worlds is different\u2014as Lee Maracle writes above,<sup>1</sup> the contexts we inherit\u2014there can never be a single way of being or becoming human, though no doubt some ways have a great deal in common with one another. That\u2019s the role of experience, of teaching, and of story\u2014to help us find ways of meaningful being in whatever worlds we inhabit, whatever contexts we\u2019ve inherited. This is what I take Thomas King\u2019s<sup>2</sup> oft-quoted words to mean: \u201cThe truth about stories is that that\u2019s all we are.\u201d Our lives are incarnations of the stories we tell, the stories told about us, and the stories we inherit. They are both the process and the consequence of the transformations into the fullness of our humanity. Indeed, without those stories, without the teachings about the who, how, and why of us, something is profoundly, almost existentially amiss. We don\u2019t need to speak them to live them; even those not given voice are inextricably embraided in our sense of self. We know ourselves only through stories. The unstoried life is a terrible thing to comprehend, a soul-deep desolation.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yet not all the stories that shape us are our own. Most, inevitably, are not, and these are the legacies we inherit, the formative context of our being. That\u2019s part of the beauty and frightening power of story: sometimes the shaping stories are an empowering blessing, sometimes they\u2019re a disfiguring curse, sometimes they offer a bit of both shadow and light. But they\u2019re always part of who we know ourselves to be.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>The chapter this passage is excerpted from begins with the following quotation from St\u00f3:l\u014d (Indigenous Canadian) poet and author Lee Maracle: \u201cRaven shaped us; we are built for transformation. Our stories prepare us for it. Find freedom in the context you inherit\u2014every context is different: discover consequences and change from within, that is the challenge. Still, there is horror at having change foisted upon you from outside.\u201d<br><sup>2</sup>Canadian Cherokee writer Thomas King</p></small>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is from a book of essays published in the early 2000s.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In attempting an analysis of Lincoln\u2019s humor one is immediately confronted with two difficulties. In the first place, many stories attributed to Lincoln were never told by him. A. K. McClure\u2019s <em>Lincoln Stories</em> is recognized as the most reliable collection, yet Isaac N. Arnold, an intimate friend of Lincoln\u2019s, wrote on the fly-leaf of his copy of this book that Lincoln probably told no more than half the stories with which McClure credited him.<sup>1</sup> To prove that Lincoln did or did not tell a particular story is often impossible, for in most cases one must rely upon hearsay evidence or reminiscences.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The second difficulty lies in the fact that the effectiveness of a joke depends in large measure upon the manner of its telling. We may not be at all amused by reading some of Lincoln\u2019s jokes or hearing them at secondhand; whereas we might have split our sides had we heard them as he told them. For Lincoln was a master of the story-telling art; and when told by a master, even a dull joke may be irresistible. \u201cHis stories may be literally retold,\u201d wrote Henry C. Whitney, \u201cevery word, period and comma, but the real humor perished with Lincoln\u201d; for \u201che provoked as much laughter by the grotesque expression of his homely face as by the abstract fun of his stories.\u201d<sup>2</sup></p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>His manner of recital, declared Judge David Davis, was \u201cin many respects unique, if not remarkable.<sup>3</sup> His countenance and all his features seemed to take part in the performance. As he neared the pith or point of the joke or story every vestige of seriousness disappeared from his face. His little gray eyes sparkled; a smile seemed to gather up, curtain-like, the corners of his mouth; his frame quivered with suppressed excitement; and when the point\u2014or \u2018nub\u2019 of the story, as he called it\u2014came, no one\u2019s laugh was heartier than his.\u201d<sup>4</sup></p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>His humor had a general appeal. Not only the circuit lawyers and the Western villagers and farmers, but even urbane Easterners readily succumbed to it. In 1842, Ex-President [Martin] Van Buren, making a tour of the West, stopped one night at the village of Rochester, a few miles from Springfield. The Democratic politicians of Springfield went out \u201cen masse\u201d to meet and entertain him, taking Lincoln and a few other Whigs along. Van Buren related several amusing incidents of New York politics, while others told tales of early life on the frontier. But all yielded at last to Lincoln, who kept them in an uproar far into the night with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of yarns, until Van Buren insisted that \u201chis sides were sore with laughing.\u201d<sup>5</sup></p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In many cases the stories Lincoln told were not original, although he often embellished and improved them. He himself repeatedly disclaimed credit for authorship and described himself as merely a retail dealer. His proficiency lay rather in a retentive memory, an uncanny power of association and histrionic skill.<sup>6</sup> \u201cHe did not forget the good things that he heard,\u201d wrote Charles Sumner, \u201cand was never without a familiar story to illustrate his meaning. When he spoke, the recent West seemed to vie with the ancient East in apologue and fable. His ideas moved, as the beasts entered Noah\u2019s ark, in pairs. At times his illustrations had a homely felicity, and with him they seemed to be not less important than the argument, which he always enforced with a certain intensity of manner and voice.\u201d<sup>7</sup></p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Much of Lincoln\u2019s success as a storyteller was due to a talent for mimicry. \u201cIn the role of storyteller,\u201d said T. G. Onstot, son of the New Salem cooper, \u201cI never knew his equal. His power of mimicry was very great.\u201d<sup>8</sup></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-size:0.9em\"><sup>1</sup> Alexander K.

        "text": "<p><em>The Royal We, Steve Olson</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>[...] Earlier this year I went to Dublin to learn more about the Irish side of my family and to talk about genealogy with Mark Humphrys, a young computer scientist at Dublin City University. Humphrys has dark hair, deep-blue eyes, heavily freckled arms, and a pasty complexion. He became interested in genealogy as a teenager, after hearing romantic stories about his ancestors' roles in rebellions against the English. [...]</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>While a graduate student at Cambridge University, Humphrys fell in love with and married an Englishwoman, and investigating her genealogy proved more fruitful. Her family knew that they were descended from an illegitimate son of the tenth Earl of Pembroke. After just a couple of hours in the Cambridge library, Humphrys showed that the Earl of Pembroke was a direct descendant of Edward III, making Humphrys's wife the King's great-granddaughter twenty generations removed. Humphrys began to gather other genealogical tidbits related to English royalty. Many of the famous Irish rebels he'd learned about in school turned out to have ancestors who had married into prominent Protestant families, which meant they were descended from English royalty. The majority of American presidents were also of royal descent, as were many of the well-known families of Europe.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Humphrys began to notice something odd. Whenever a reliable family tree was available, almost anyone of European ancestry turned out to be descended from English royalty\u2014even such unlikely people as Hermann G\u00f6ring and Daniel Boone. Humphrys began to think that such descent was the rule rather than the exception in the Western world, even if relatively few people had the documents to demonstrate it.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Humphrys compiled his family genealogies first on paper and then using computers. He did much of his work on royal genealogies in the mid-1990s, when the World Wide Web was just coming into general use. He began to put his findings on Web pages, with hyperlinks connecting various lines of descent. Suddenly dense networks of ancestry jumped out at him. \"I'd known these descents were interconnected, but I'd never known how much,\" he told me. \"You can't see the connections reading the printed genealogies, because it's so hard to jump from tree to tree. The problem is that genealogies aren't two-dimensional, so any attempt to put them on paper is more or less doomed from the start. They aren't three-dimensional, either, or you could make a structure. They have hundreds of dimensions.\"</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Much of Humphrys's genealogical research now appears on his Web page Royal Descents of Famous People. Sitting in his office, I asked him to show me how it works. He clicked on the name Walt Disney. Up popped a genealogy done by Brigitte Gastel Lloyd (Humphrys links to the work of others whenever possible) showing the twenty-two generations separating Disney from Edward I. Humphrys pointed at the screen. \"Here we have a sir, so this woman is the daughter of a knight. Maybe this woman will marry nobility, but there's a limited pool of nobility, so eventually someone here is going to marry someone who's just wealthy. Then one of their children could marry someone who doesn't have that much money. In ten generations you can easily get from princess to peasant.\"</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The idea that virtually anyone with a European ancestor descends from English royalty seems bizarre, but it accords perfectly with some recent research done by Joseph Chang, a statistician at Yale University. The mathematics of our ancestry is exceedingly complex, because the number of our ancestors increases exponentially, not linearly. These numbers are manageable in the first few generations\u2014two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, sixteen great-great-grandparents\u2014but they quickly spiral out of control. Go back forty generations, or about a thousand years, and each of us theoretically has more than a trillion direct ancestors\u2014a figure that far exceeds the total number of human beings who have ever lived. [...]</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The dense interconnectedness of the human family might seem to take some of the thrill out of genealogical research. Sure, I was able to show in the Genealogical Office that my Siggins ancestors are descended from the fourteenth-century Syggens of County Wexford; but I'm also descended from most of the other people who lived in Ireland in the fourteenth century. Humphrys took issue with my disillusionment. It's true that everyone's roots go back to the same family tree, he said. But each path to our common past is different, and reconstructing that path, using whatever records are available, is its own reward. \"You can ask whether everyone in the Western world is descended from Charlemagne, and the answer is yes, we're all descended from Charlemagne. But can you prove it? That's the game of genealogy.\"</p>",

(8)&nbsp;This anomaly signified that the woman must have engaged in a long-term strenuous activity involving the right side of her body. (9)&nbsp;Seeking more exact information, the researchers drew on their assumptions about the kinds of work women performed in ancient Greece.

(12)&nbsp;Success came in 2018 when a female ceramicist modeled her work for the researchers. (13)&nbsp;Analyzing her movements as she worked on large vases and listening to her detail the physical toll of the work, the team was convinced that the ancient Eleuthernan woman whose skeleton it was studying must have been a potter, a guess later confirmed by medical imaging and further anatomical modeling.</p><p>(14)&nbsp;The woman was not just a ceramicist, though. (15)&nbsp;The extent of wear on her remains indicates that she was a <em>master </em>ceramicist.

Monarchs had, so to speak, materialized oppression; the democratic republics of the present day have rendered it as entirely an affair of the mind as the will which it is intended to coerce. Under the absolute sway of one man the body was attacked in order to subdue the soul; but the soul escaped the blows which were directed against it and rose proudly superior. Such is not the course adopted by tyranny in democratic republics; there the body is left free, and the soul is enslaved. The master no longer says: \u201dYou shall think as I do or you shall die\u201c; but he says: \u201cYou are free to think differently from me and to retain your life, your property, and all that you possess; but you are henceforth a stranger among your people. You may retain your civil rights, but they will be useless to you, for you will never be chosen by your fellow citizens if you solicit their votes; and they will affect to scorn you if you ask for their esteem. You will remain among men, but you will be deprived of the rights of mankind. Your fellow creatures will shun you like an impure being; and even those who believe in your innocence will abandon you, lest they should be shunned in their turn. Go in peace! I have given you your life, but it is an existence worse than death.\u201d</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Absolute monarchies had dishonored despotism; let us beware lest democratic republics should reinstate it and render it less odious and degrading in the eyes of the many by making it still more onerous to the few.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Works have been published in the proudest nations of the Old World expressly intended to censure the vices and the follies of the times: La Bruy\u00e8re inhabited the palace of Louis XIV when he composed his chapter upon the Great, and Moli\u00e8re criticized the courtiers in the plays that were acted before the court. But the ruling power in the United States is not to be made game of. The smallest reproach irritates its sensibility, and the slightest joke that has any foundation in truth renders it indignant; from the forms of its language up to the solid virtues of its character, everything must be made the subject of encomium. No writer, whatever be his eminence, can escape paying this tribute of adulation to his fellow citizens. The majority lives in the perpetual utterance of self-applause, and there are certain truths which the Americans can learn only from strangers or from experience.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The passage below is an excerpt from an essay published in the late twentieth century.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>An old photograph in a cheap frame hangs on a wall of the room where I work. It\u2019s a picture dating from 1946 of a house into which, at the time of its taking, I had not yet been born. The house is rather peculiar\u2014a three-storeyed gabled affair with tiled roofs and round towers in two corners, each wearing a pointy tiled hat. \u2018The past is a foreign country,\u2019 goes the famous opening sentence of L. P. Hartley\u2019s novel <em>The Go-Between</em>, \u2018they do things differently there.\u2019 But the photograph tells me to invert this idea; it reminds me that it\u2019s my present that is foreign, and that the past is home, albeit a lost home in a lost city in the mists of lost time.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A few years ago I revisited Bombay,<sup>1</sup> which is my lost city, after an absence of something like half my life. Shortly after arriving, acting on an impulse, I opened the telephone directory and looked for my father\u2019s name. And, amazingly, there it was; his name, our old address, the unchanged telephone number, as if we had never gone away to the unmentionable country across the border. It was an eerie discovery. I felt as if I were being claimed, or informed that the facts of my faraway life were illusions, and that this continuity was the reality. Then I went to visit the house in the photograph and stood outside it, neither daring nor wishing to announce myself to its new owners. (I didn\u2019t want to see how they\u2019d ruined the interior.) I was overwhelmed. The photograph had naturally been taken in black and white; and my memory, feeding on such images as this, had begun to see my childhood in the same way, monochromatically. The colours of my history had seeped out of my mind\u2019s eye; now my other two eyes were assaulted by colours, by the vividness of the red tiles, the yellow-edged green of cactus-leaves, the brilliance of bougainvillaea creeper. It is probably not too romantic to say that that was when my novel <em>Midnight\u2019s Children </em>was really born; when I realized how much I wanted to restore the past to myself, not in the faded greys of old family-album snapshots, but whole, in CinemaScope and glorious Technicolor.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Bombay is a city built by foreigners upon reclaimed land; I, who had been away so long that I almost qualified for the title, was gripped by the conviction that I, too, had a city and a history to reclaim.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It may be that writers in my position, exiles or emigrants or expatriates, are haunted by some sense of loss, some urge to reclaim, to look back, even at the risk of being mutated into pillars of salt.<sup>2</sup> But if we do look back, we must also do so in the knowledge\u2014which gives rise to profound uncertainties\u2014that our physical alienation from India almost inevitably means that we will not be capable of reclaiming precisely the thing that was lost; that we will, in short, create fictions, not actual cities or villages, but invisible ones, imaginary homelands, Indias of the mind.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Writing my book in North London, looking out through my window on to a city scene totally unlike the ones I was imagining on to paper, I was constantly plagued by this problem, until I felt obliged to face it in the text, to make clear that (in spite of my original and I suppose somewhat Proustian ambition to unlock the gates of lost time so that the past reappeared as it actually had been, unaffected by the distortions of memory) what I was actually doing was a novel of memory and about memory, so that my India was just that: \u2018my\u2019 India, a version and no more than one version of all the hundreds of millions of possible versions. I tried to make it as imaginatively true as I could, but imaginative truth is simultaneously honourable and suspect, and I knew that my India may only have been one to which I (who am no longer what I was, and who by quitting Bombay never became what perhaps I was meant to be) was, let us say, willing to admit I belonged.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is why I made my narrator, Saleem, suspect in his narration; his mistakes are the mistakes of a fallible memory compounded by quirks of character and of circumstance, and his vision is fragmentary. It may be that when the Indian writer who writes from outside India tries to reflect that world, he is obliged to deal in broken mirrors, some of whose fragments have been irretrievably lost.</p><hr><small><p><span><sup>1</sup>The city of Mumbai, India, was commonly known as Bombay until the mid-1990s.</span><br><span><sup>2</sup>an allusion to a biblical story in which Lot\u2019s wife disobeys a divine command against looking back at her city and is punished by being transformed into a pillar of salt</span></p></small>",

When pitched headforemost into the world I landed in a crib of negroism. From the earliest rocking of my cradle, I had known about the capers Brer Rabbit is apt to cut and what the Squinch Owl says from the house top. But it was fitting me like a tight chemise. I couldn\u2019t see it for wearing it. It was only when I was off in college, away from my native surroundings, that I could see myself like somebody else and stand off and look at my garment. Then I had to have the spy-glass of Anthropology to look through at that.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dr. Boas asked me where I wanted to work and I said, \u201cFlorida,\u201d and gave, as my big reason, that \u201cFlorida is a place that draws people\u2014white people from all over the world, and Negroes from every Southern state surely and some from the North and West.\u201d So I knew that it was possible for me to get a cross section of the Negro South in the one state. And then I realized that I was new myself, so it looked sensible for me to choose familiar ground.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>First place I aimed to stop to collect material was Eatonville, Florida.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And now, I\u2019m going to tell you why I decided to go to my native village first. I didn\u2019t go back there so that the home folks could make admiration over me because I had been up North to college and come back with a diploma and a Chevrolet. I knew they were not going to pay either one of these items too much mind. I was just Lucy Hurston\u2019s daughter, Zora, and even if I had\u2014to use one of our down-home expressions\u2014had a Kaiser baby, and that\u2019s something that hasn\u2019t been done in this Country yet, I\u2019d still be just Zora to the neighbors. If I had exalted myself to impress the town, somebody would have sent me word in a match-box that I had been up North there and had rubbed the hair off of my head against some college wall, and then come back there with a lot of form and fashion and outside show to the world. But they\u2019d stand flat-footed and tell me that they didn\u2019t have me, neither my sham-polish, to study \u2019bout. And that would have been that.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I hurried back to Eatonville because I knew that the town was full of material and that I could get it without hurt, harm or danger. As early as I could remember it was the habit of the men folks particularly to gather on the store porch of evenings and swap stories. Even the women folks would stop and break a breath with them at times. As a child when I was sent down to Joe Clarke\u2019s store, I\u2019d drag out my leaving as long as possible in order to hear more.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Folk-lore is not as easy to collect as it sounds.

An aircraft was standing on the runway. \u2018Look! Look!\u2019 Someone\u2014presumably my brother\u2014 was waving a handkerchief at us from a port-hole. I seem to recall too the roar of the engines, the aircraft climbing into a blank, blue sky, becoming smaller as it rose higher, shrinking into an ever-diminishing point of metallic glitter . . . disappearing.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I would have been about five years old at the time\u2014the baby of the family. On that day my brother had disappeared into regions unknown to me; and so became, as I have said, cloaked with an unreality I found impenetrable. But this unreality, however abstract, however bloodless, was loaded with implication for me. My brother, by reason of his academic successes, had established a pattern, a set of standards. Willy-nilly, these were transformed into a sort of Absolute\u2014small-island, colonial style: willy-nilly, my character, my actual performance, my \u2018promise\u2019, would be judged against the expectations generated by that Absolute. <em>He </em>had won an \u2018Exhibition\u2019 (a type of scholarship) to a good secondary school. Would <em>I? He </em>had won a Trinidad Government scholarship that had taken him to Oxford. Would <em>I? </em>Invariably\u2014how could it be otherwise?\u2014I suffered by comparison. No one ever quite lives up to the demands of an Absolute. You gaze into mirrors\u2014school reports, other faces, overheard opinions\u2014and all you ever see reflected are your own inadequacies; the treasons you are alleged to have inflicted on a self-contained, self-sustaining regime of preconceived and unexamined expectations. I became \u2018sensitised\u2019 at an early age to discourtesy and stupidity. Those without imagination are doomed to these twin vices. Looking back on myself, I see that I was a difficult, moody and enigmatic child. It was a form of self-protection against the tyrannies that sought to imprison me, that offered me neither compassion nor courtesy. And\u2014perhaps\u2014the child has developed into a difficult, moody and enigmatic man. He doesn\u2019t like to think he is . . . but he recognizes, glancing into the mirrors that offer themselves, he may be.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Incidents come to mind\u2014some of which still cause me pain. There was that most august relative of mine who (I was probably about ten years old at the time), when I baulked at eating with my hands\u2014I can no longer remember what led up to that petty action of rebellion\u2014remarked: \u2018Wait until <em>you </em>get to Oxford. <em>You </em>haven\u2019t got in there yet.

Some people have a foolish trick of applying for aid before they have done anything whatever to aid themselves, and in fact try to talk themselves into perspicuity. The only way in which they can think is by talking, and their speech consequently is not the expression of opinion already and carefully formed, but the manufacture of it.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We may also tell our troubles to those who are suffering if we can lessen their own. It may be a very great relief to them to know that others have passed through trials equal to theirs and have survived. There are obscure, nervous diseases, hypochondriac fancies, almost uncontrollable impulses, which terrify by their apparent singularity. If we could believe that they are common, the worst of the fear would vanish.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But, as a rule, we should be very careful for our own sake not to speak much about what distresses us. Expression is apt to carry with it exaggeration, and this exaggerated form becomes henceforth that under which we represent our miseries to ourselves, so that they are thereby increased. By reserve, on the other hand, they are diminished, for we attach less importance to that which it was not worth while to mention. Secrecy, in fact, may be our salvation.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is injurious to be always treated as if something were the matter with us. It is health-giving to be dealt with as if we were healthy, and the man who imagines his wits are failing becomes stronger and sounder by being entrusted with a difficult problem than by all the assurances of a doctor.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>They are poor creatures who are always craving for pity. If we are sick, let us prefer conversation upon<em> </em>any subject rather than upon ourselves. Let it turn on matters that lie outside the dark chamber, upon the last new discovery, or the last new idea. So shall we seem still to be linked to the living world. By perpetually asking for sympathy an end is put to real friendship. The friend is afraid to intrude anything which has no direct reference to the patient\u2019s condition lest it should be thought irrelevant. No love even can long endure without complaint, silent it may be, against an invalid who is entirely self-centered; and what an agony it is to know that we are tended simply as a duty by those who are nearest to us, and that they will really be relieved when we have departed! From this torture we may be saved if we early apprentice ourselves to the art of self-suppression and sternly apply the gag to eloquence upon our own woes. Nobody who really cares for us will mind waiting on us even to the long-delayed last hour if we endure in fortitude.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There is no harm in confronting our disorders or misfortunes. On the contrary, the attempt is wholesome. Much of what we dread is really due to indistinctness of outline. If we have the courage to say to ourselves, What <em>is </em>this thing, then? let the worst come to the worst, and what then? we shall frequently find that after all it is not so terrible. What we have to do is to subdue tremulous, nervous, insane fright. Fright is often prior to an object; that is to say, the fright comes first and something is invented or discovered to account for it. There are certain states of body and mind which are productive of objectless fright, and the most ridiculous thing in the world is able to provoke it to activity. It is perhaps not too much to say that any calamity the moment it is apprehended by the reason alone loses nearly all its power to disturb and unfix us. The conclusions which are so alarming are not those of the reason, but, to use Spinoza\u2019s words, of the \u201caffects.\u201d</p>",

Estimations of the expected warming effects of this increase were equivalent to .36\u00b0F per decade. Amazingly, the effect of the increase in cirriform clouds alone was considered sufficient to account for almost the entire rise in temperatures across the USA during the last 25 years.

Here, the scientists correlated the changing distribution of cirriform clouds over Europe from weather satellite images with precise records of the varying concentrations of air traffic during the same periods.

Ironically, modern aircraft engines\u2014designed to burn more efficiently and so emit less CO<sub>2</sub>\u2014actually create more contrails.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A team of scientists at Imperial College in London has been looking at one possible way to reduce contrails: stopping aircraft from flying so high.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Using computer simulations designed for air-traffic management, they have considered the implications of imposing restrictions on European cruising altitudes to keep aircraft below contrail-forming levels.<sup>4</sup>  One problem with such a system is that the lower an airplane flies, the denser the air it has to travel through and so the more fuel it needs to burn\u2014 something that has financial implications as well as those of increased greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So the team evaluated a system that imposed the highest possible \u2018contrail-free\u2019 ceiling on cruising altitudes, which could be calculated dynamically in response to changes in atmospheric temperature and humidity.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u2018If you had that cap on the flights in Europe\u2014\u2019 explained Dr. Bob Noland, one of the scientists behind the project, \u2018which would result in a four percent increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from increased fuel consumption\u2014our conclusion was that the reduction in contrails would make it a good policy.\u2019 Their findings suggested that, though there would certainly be implementation difficulties, such as increased congestion and longer flight times, the system could reduce contrail formation by between 65 and 95 percent, compared with just a four percent rise in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Without the contrails it seems that there would be a considerable reduction in the overall amount of thin, ground-warming cirriform clouds. \u2018The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from aircraft,\u2019 says Noland, \u2018while significant and growing, are not going to make that much difference even if we cut them down, but if we reduce contrails by 90 percent tomorrow\u2014which we think is entirely feasible\u2014you would get a major impact right away. Stopping the contrails would bring an immediate benefit.\u2019</p><hr><small><p><span><sup>1</sup> Minnis, P.; Ayers, J.

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is from a book published in the 1980s.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the world of the southern black community I grew up in, \u201cback talk\u201d and \u201ctalking back\u201d meant speaking as an equal to an authority figure. It meant daring to disagree and sometimes it just meant having an opinion. In the \u201cold school,\u201d children were meant to be seen and not heard. My great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents were all from the old school. To make yourself heard if you were a child was to invite punishment, the back-hand lick, the slap across the face that would catch you unaware, or the feel of switches stinging your arms and legs.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>To speak then when one was not spoken to was a courageous act\u2014an act of risk and daring. And yet it was hard not to speak in warm rooms where heated discussions began at the crack of dawn, women\u2019s voices filling the air, giving orders, making threats, fussing. Black men may have excelled in the art of poetic preaching in the male-dominated church, but in the church of the home, where the everyday rules of how to live and how to act were established, it was black women who preached. There, black women spoke in a language so rich, so poetic, that it felt to me like being shut off from life, smothered to death if one were not allowed to participate.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was in that world of woman talk (the men were often silent, often absent) that was born in me the craving to speak, to have a voice, and not just any voice but one that could be identified as belonging to me. To make my voice, I had to speak, to hear myself talk\u2014and talk I did\u2014darting in and out of grown folks\u2019 conversations and dialogues, answering questions that were not directed at me, endlessly asking questions, making speeches. Needless to say, the punishments for these acts of speech seemed endless. They were intended to silence me\u2014the child \u2014and more particularly the girl child. Had I been a boy, they might have encouraged me to speak believing that I might someday be called to preach. There was no \u201ccalling\u201d for talking girls, no legitimized rewarded speech. The punishments I received for \u201ctalking back\u201d were intended to suppress all possibility that I would create my own speech. That speech was to be suppressed so that the \u201cright speech of womanhood\u201d would emerge.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Within feminist circles, silence is often seen as the sexist \u201cright speech of womanhood\u201d\u2014the sign of woman\u2019s submission to patriarchal authority. This emphasis on woman\u2019s silence may be an accurate remembering of what has taken place in the households of women from WASP* backgrounds in the United States, but in black communities (and diverse ethnic communities), women have not been silent. Their voices can be heard. Certainly for black women, our struggle has not been to emerge from silence into speech but to change the nature and direction of our speech, to make a speech that compels listeners, one that is heard.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Our speech, \u201cthe right speech of womanhood,\u201d was often the soliloquy, the talking into thin air, the talking to ears that do not hear you\u2014the talk that is simply not listened to. Unlike the black male preacher whose speech was to be heard, who was to be listened to, whose words were to be remembered, the voices of black women\u2014giving orders, making threats, fussing \u2014could be tuned out, could become a kind of background music, audible but not acknowledged as significant speech. Dialogue\u2014the sharing of speech and recognition\u2014took place not between mother and child or mother and male authority figure but among black women. I can remember watching fascinated as our mother talked with her mother, sisters, and women friends. The intimacy and intensity of their speech\u2014the satisfaction they received from talking to one another, the pleasure, the joy. It was in this world of woman speech, loud talk, angry words, women with tongues quick and sharp, tender sweet tongues, touching our world with their words, that I made speech my birthright\u2014and the right to voice, to authorship, a privilege I would not be denied. It was in that world and because of it that I came to dream of writing, to write.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Writing was a way to capture speech, to hold onto it, keep it close. And so I wrote down bits and pieces of conversations, confessing in cheap diaries that soon fell apart from too much handling, expressing the intensity of my sorrow, the anguish of speech\u2014for I was always saying the wrong thing, asking the wrong questions. I could not confine my speech to the necessary corners and concerns of life. I hid these writings under my bed, in pillow stuffings, among faded underwear. When my sisters found and read them, they ridiculed and mocked me\u2014poking fun. I felt violated, ashamed, as if the secret parts of myself had been exposed, brought into the open, and hung like newly clean laundry, out in the air for everyone to see. The fear of exposure, the fear that one\u2019s deepest emotions and innermost thoughts will be dismissed as mere nonsense, felt by so many young girls keeping diaries, holding and hiding speech, seems to me now one of the barriers that women have always needed and still need to destroy so that we are no longer pushed into secrecy or silence.</p><hr><small><p><span>* White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, a colloquial term used to identify a group of middle- or upper-class Americans often perceived to be especially privileged and powerful</span></p></small>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The following is excerpted from a recent nonfiction book.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Pragmatism is an account of the way people think\u2014the way they come up with ideas, form beliefs, and reach decisions. What makes us decide to do one thing when we might do another thing instead? The question seems unanswerable, since life presents us with many types of choices, and no single explanation can be expected to cover every case. Deciding whether to order the lobster or the steak is not the same sort of thing as deciding whether the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In the first case (assuming price is not an object) we consult our taste; in the second we consult our judgment, and try to keep our taste out of it. But knowing more or less what category a particular decision belongs to\u2014 knowing whether it is a matter of personal preference or a matter of impersonal judgment\u2014doesn\u2019t make that decision any easier to make. \u201cOrder what you feel like eating,\u201d says your impatient dinner companion. But the problem is that you don\u2019t <em>know </em>what you feel like eating. What you feel like eating is precisely what you are trying to figure out.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cOrder what you feel like eating\u201d is just a piece of advice about the criteria you should be using to guide your deliberations. It is not a solution to your menu problem\u2014just as \u201cDo the right thing\u201d and \u201cTell the truth\u201d are only suggestions about criteria, not answers to actual dilemmas. The actual dilemma is what, in the particular case staring you in the face, the right thing to do or the honest thing to say really is. And making those kinds of decisions\u2014about what is right or what is truthful\u2014<em>is </em>like deciding what to order in a restaurant, in the sense that getting a handle on tastiness is no harder or easier (even though it is generally less important) than getting a handle on justice or truth.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>People reach decisions, most of the time, by thinking. This is a pretty banal statement, but the process it names is inscrutable. An acquaintance gives you a piece of information in strict confidence; later on, a close friend, lacking that information, is about to make a bad mistake. Do you betray the confidence? \u201cDo the right thing\u201d\u2014but what is the right thing? Keeping your word, or helping someone you care about avoid injury or embarrassment? Even in this two-sentence hypothetical case, the choice between principles is complicated\u2014as it always is in life\u2014by circumstances. If it had been the close friend who gave you the information and the acquaintance who was about to make the mistake, you would almost certainly think about your choice differently\u2014as you would if you thought that the acquaintance was a nasty person, or that the friend was a lucky person, or that the statute of limitations on the secret had probably run out, or that you had acquired a terrible habit of betraying confidences and really ought to break it. In the end, you will do what you believe is \u201cright,\u201d but \u201crightness\u201d will be, in effect, the compliment you give to the outcome of your deliberations. Though it is always in view while you are thinking, \u201cwhat is right\u201d is something that appears in its complete form at the end, not the beginning, of your deliberation.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When we think, in other words, we do not simply consult principles, or reasons, or sentiments, or tastes; for prior to thinking, all those things are indeterminate. Thinking is what makes them real. Deciding to order the lobster helps us determine that we have a taste for lobster; deciding that the defendant is guilty helps us establish the standard of justice that applies in this case; choosing to keep a confidence helps make honesty a principle and choosing to betray it helps to confirm the value we put on friendship.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Does this mean that our choices are arbitrary or self-serving\u2014that standards and principles are just whatever it is in our interest to say they are, pretexts for satisfying selfish ends or gratifying hidden impulses? There is no way to answer this question, except to say that it rarely <em>feels </em>as though this is the case. We usually don\u2019t end up deciding to do what seems pleasant or convenient at the moment; experience teaches us that this is rarely a wise basis for making a choice. (\u201cIf merely \u2018feeling good\u2019 could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience,\u201d as James* once put it.) When we are happy with a decision, it doesn\u2019t feel arbitrary; it feels like the decision we <em>had </em>to reach. And this is because its inevitability is a function of its \u201cfit\u201d with the whole inchoate set of assumptions of our self understanding and of the social world we inhabit, the assumptions that give the moral weight\u2014much greater moral weight than logic or taste could ever give\u2014to every judgment we make. This is why, so often, we know we\u2019re right before we know <em>why </em>we\u2019re right. First we decide, then we deduce.</p><hr><small><p><span>*William James (1842\u20131910), American philosopher and psychologist, was a leader of the philosophical movement of Pragmatism.</span></p></small>",

Rumors of \"JCO\"* come to me thirdhand and usually unrecognizable, arguing, absurdly, for her historical existence. But while <em>writing</em> exists, <em>writers</em> do not \u2013 as all writers know. It's true, I see her photograph \u2013 my \"likeness\" \u2013 yet it is rarely the same \"likeness\" from photograph to photograph, and the expression is usually one of faint bewilderment. <em>\"I acknowledge that I share a name and a face with \"JCO,\" </em>this expression suggests, <em>but this is a mere convenience.

He is the most effective educator who aims less at perfecting specific acquirements than at producing that mental condition which renders acquirements easy, and leads to their useful application; who does not seek to make his pupils moral by enjoining particular courses of action, but by bringing into activity the feelings and sympathies that must issue in noble action. On the same ground it may be said that the most effective writer is not he who announces a particular discovery, who convinces men of a particular conclusion, who demonstrates that this measure is right and that measure wrong; but he who rouses in others the activities that must issue in discovery, who awakes men from their indifference to the right and the wrong, who nerves their energies to seek for the truth and live up to it at whatever cost. The influence of such a writer is dynamic. He does not teach men how to use sword and musket, but he inspires their souls with courage and sends a strong will into their muscles. He does not, perhaps, enrich your stock of data, but he clears away the film from your eyes that you may search for data to some purpose. He does not, perhaps, convince you, but he strikes you, undeceives you, animates you. You are not directly fed by his books, but you are braced as by a walk up to an alpine summit, and yet subdued to calm and reverence as by the sublime things to be seen from that summit.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Such a writer is Thomas Carlyle. It is an idle question to ask whether his books will be read a century hence: if they were all burnt as the grandest of Suttees<sup>1</sup> on his funeral pile, it would be only like cutting down an oak after its acorns have sown a forest. For there is hardly a superior or active mind of this generation that has not been modified by Carlyle\u2019s writings; there has hardly been an English book written for the last ten or twelve years that would not have been different if Carlyle had not lived. The character of his influence is best seen in the fact that many of the men who have the least agreement with his opinions are those to whom the reading of <em>Sartor Resartus </em>was an epoch in the history of their minds. The extent of his influence may be best seen in the fact that ideas which were startling novelties when he first wrote them are now become common-places. And we think few men will be found to say that this influence on the whole has not been for good. There are plenty who question the justice of Carlyle\u2019s estimates of past men and past times, plenty who quarrel with the exaggerations of the <em>Latter-Day Pamphlets</em>, and who are as far as possible from looking for an amendment of things from a Carlylian theocracy with the \u2018greatest man\u2019, as a Joshua who is to smite the wicked (and the stupid) till the going down of the sun.<sup>2</sup> But for any large nature, those points of difference are quite incidental. It is not as a theorist, but as a great and beautiful human nature, that Carlyle influences us. You may meet a man whose wisdom seems unimpeachable, since you find him entirely in agreement with yourself; but this oracular man of unexceptionable opinions has a green eye, a wiry hand, and altogether a <em>Wesen</em>, or demeanour, that makes the world look blank to you, and whose unexceptionable opinions become a bore; while another man who deals in what you cannot but think \u2018dangerous paradoxes\u2019, warms your heart by the pressure of his hand, and looks out on the world with so clear and loving an eye, that nature seems to reflect the light of his glance upon your own feeling. So it is with Carlyle. When he is saying the very opposite of what we think, he says it so finely, with so hearty conviction\u2014he makes the object about which we differ stand out in such grand relief under the clear light of his strong and honest intellect\u2014he appeals so constantly to our sense of the manly and the truthful\u2014that we are obliged to say \u2018Hear! hear!\u2019 to the writer before we can give the decorous \u2018Oh! oh!\u2019 to his opinions.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup> A suttee is a now-obsolete Hindu funeral practice.<br><sup>2</sup> Carlyle believed that great men, or heroes, shaped history through their personal actions and divine inspiration.

        "text": "<div><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Is the English language\u2014or, to put it less apocalyptically, English prose writing\u2014really in a bad way? How would one tell? The standard jeremiads of the Sunday supplements give only anecdotal evidence, and that of a curious sort; the examples of degradation that they present are drawn not from current plays or novels, which are grammatically and syntactically <em>extra judicium</em>, but from advertisements, scholarly papers, and\u2014most popular of all\u2014memos from college deans. It is hard to believe that any of these texts will survive even until the next century, much less that late-twentieth-century English will be judged by their example. Our picture of the English of previous centuries, after all, has been formed on the basis of a careful selection of the best that was said and thought back then; <em>their</em> hacks and bureaucrats are mercifully silent now. But while it is understandable that speakers of a language with a literary tradition would tend to be pessimistic about its course, there is no more hard evidence for a general linguistic degeneration than there is reason to believe that Aaron and Rose are inferior to Ruth and Gehrig.<sup>1</sup></p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Most of my fellow linguists, in fact, would say that it is absurd even to talk about a language changing for the better or the worse. When you have the historical picture before you, and can see how Indo-European gradually slipped into Germanic, Germanic into Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Saxon into the English of Chaucer, then Shakespeare, and then Henry James, the process of linguistic change seems as ineluctable and impersonal as continental drift. From this Olympian point of view, not even the Norman invasion had much of an effect on the structure of the language, and all the tirades of all the grammarians since the Renaissance sound like the prattlings of landscape gardeners who hope by frantic efforts to keep Alaska from bumping into Asia.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The long run will surely prove the linguists right: English will survive whatever \u201cabuses\u201d its current critics complain of. And by that I mean not just that people will go on using English and its descendants in their daily commerce but that they will continue to make art with it as well. Yet it is hard to take comfort in the scholars\u2019' sanguine detachment. We all know what Keynes<sup>2</sup> said about the long run, and in the meantime does it really matter not at all how we choose to speak and write? It may be that my children will use <em>gift</em> and <em>impact</em> as verbs without the slightest compunction (just as I used <em>contact</em>, wondering that anyone ever bothered to object to it). But I can\u2019t overcome the feeling that it is wrong for me to use them in that way and that people of my generation who say \u201cWe decided to gift them with a desk set\u201d are in some sense guilty of a moral lapse, whether because they are ignorant or because they are weak. In the face of that conviction, it really doesn\u2019t matter to me whether <em>to gift</em> will eventually prevail, carried on the historical tide. Our glory, Silone<sup>3</sup> said, lies in not having to submit to history.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Linguistic manners are like any others. People have always found it worthwhile to reflect on how best to behave, for the sake of at least individual enlightenment and improvement. Since the eighteenth century, most of our great moralists have at one time or another turned their attention to the language, from Addison, Swift, and Johnson to Arnold, James, Shaw, Mencken, and Orwell. In their essays and in the great grammars and dictionaries, we find the most direct secular continuation of the homiletic tradition, reflecting the conviction that the mastery of polite prose is a moral accomplishment, to which we will be moved by appeals to our highest instincts.</p><hr><small><p><span><sup>1</sup>Aaron, Rose, Ruth, and Gehrig were professional baseball players.

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is excerpted from a recent nonfiction book.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Four fish, then. Or rather four archetypes of fish flesh, which humanity is trying to master in one way or another, either through the management of a wild system, through the domestication and farming of individual species, or through the outright substitution of one species for another.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is not the first time humanity has glanced across the disorderly range of untamed nature and selected a handful of species to exploit and propagate. Out of all of the many mammals that roamed the earth before the last ice age, our forebears selected four\u2014 cows, pigs, sheep, and goats\u2014to be their principal meats.<sup>1 </sup>Out of all the many birds that darkened the primeval skies, humans chose four\u2014chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese\u2014to be their poultry. But today, as we evaluate and parse fish in this next great selection and try to figure out which ones will be our principals, we find ourselves with a more complex set of decisions before us. Early man put very little thought into preserving his wild food. He was in the minority in nature, and the creatures he chose to domesticate for his table were a subset of a much greater, wilder whole. He had no idea of his destructive potential or of his abilities to remake the world.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Modern man is a different animal, one who is fully aware of his capability to skew the rules of nature in his favor. Up until the mid-twentieth century, humans tended to see their transformative abilities as not only positive but inevitable. Francis Galton, a leading Victorian intellectual, infamously known as the founder of eugenics but also a prolific writer on a wide range of subjects including animal domestication, wrote at the dawn of the industrialization of the world\u2019s food system, \u201cIt would appear that every wild animal has had its chance of being domesticated.\u201d<sup>2</sup> Of the undomesticated animals left behind, Galton had this depressing prediction: \u201cAs civilization extends they are doomed to be gradually destroyed off the face of the earth as useless consumers of cultivated produce.\u201d</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And that brings us to the present day, the crucial point at which we stand in our current relationship with the ocean. Must we eliminate all wildness from the sea and replace it with some kind of human controlled system, or can wildness be understood and managed well enough to keep humanity and the marine world in balance? In spite of the impression given by numerous reports in the news media, wild fish still exist in great numbers. The wild harvest from the ocean is now around 90 million tons<sup>3</sup> a year. The many cycles and subcycles that spin and generate food are still spinning, sometimes with great vigor, and they require absolutely no input from us in order to continue, other than restraint. In cases where grounds have been seemingly tapped out, ten years\u2019 rest has sometimes been enough to restore them to at least some of their former glory. World War II, while one of the most devastating periods in history for humans, might be called \u201cThe Great Reprieve\u201d if history were written by fish.<sup>4</sup> With mines and submarines ready to blow up any unsuspecting fishing vessel, much of the North Atlantic\u2019s depleted fishing grounds were left fallow and fish increased their numbers significantly.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But is modern man capable of <em>consciously </em>creating restraint without some outside force, like war? Is there some wiser incarnation of the hunter-gatherer that will compel us to truly conserve our wild food, or is humanity actually hardwired to eradicate the wild majority and then domesticate a tiny subset? Can we not resist the urge to remake a wild system, to redirect the energy flow of that system in a way that serves us?</p><hr><small><p><span><sup>1</sup> <strong>principal meats</strong>: My summaries of animal breeding and the histories of domestication derive from Trygve Gjedrem, <em>Selection and Breeding Programs in Aquaculture </em>(New York: Springer, 2005).</span><br><span><sup>2</sup> <strong>\u201cIt would appear that every wild animal\u201d</strong>: Francis Galton as cited in Juliet Clutton-Brock, <em>A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals </em>(New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999). In addition to his writing on eugenics, animal domestication, and many other topics, Galton was a cousin of Charles Darwin and is considered to be one of the founders of the school of statistical genetics.</span><br><span><sup>3</sup> <strong>around 90 million tons</strong>: Most of my larger macro-level fisheries data are drawn from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s latest biennial report <em>The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2008</em>, ed.

The marine ecologist Daniel Pauly and others have repeatedly stressed that the Republic of China\u2019s overestimation of aquaculture production and wild catch could significantly skew the overall global data in FAO\u2019s statistics. In particular, Pauly takes issue with the assessment that aquaculture is now 50 percent of the world\u2019s seafood supply and warns that the actual number may be much lower. While I agree that the data may be skewed, the trend of the rise of aquaculture is unmistakable. If we have not reached a point of 50% aquacultured seafood by now we surely will reach that number within a decade or two.</span><br><span><sup>4</sup> <strong>if history were written by fish</strong>: The observation that World War II represented a reprieve for groundfish in the North Atlantic is based on an interview conducted with Daniel Pauly in the summer of 2005. Other researchers, most notably Jeff Hutchinson at Dalhousie University, disagree on this point. Whether or not a difference in groundfish numbers before and after World War II can be quantified, it is nevertheless undeniable that fishing pressure declined during the war and that fishing pressure, globally, increased progressively from 1950 through the present day.</span></p></small>",

Staged like an actual book-group meeting, with invited discussants and a cozy living-room setting, the Winfrey show can boost a featured title to instant bestsellerdom and turn authors into stars.

In living rooms and bookshops, clubs are frazzling under the stress, giving rise to a whole new profession: the book-group therapist.\u2019<sup>5</sup> The clubs that Elaine Daspin describes here seem to be functioning as unconsciousness- rather than consciousness-raising sessions, where competitive readers battle for interpretive supremacy.

Yet despite the fact that shared discussion of literary texts is also the foundation of literary study in school, college, and university classrooms, literary theorists and reader-response critics have yet to devote much attention to such shared and synergistic study, instead construing readers as isolates or abstractions. (Studies tend to focus on the emotional responses or cognitive activities of individual readers, or to infer such reactions by examining the properties of a literary text.)

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is from an essay published in the 1920s.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Human beings are curious creatures, and in nothing more curious than in the forms of diversion which they devise for themselves. Some of these are quite comprehensible; they give physical or mental pleasure. Bathing in the sea, for instance; or watching a play; or visiting the Zoo; or eating agreeable food at someone else\u2019s expense, or even at one\u2019s own; or playing some game with a ball. It is easy to understand that having one\u2019s person surrounded by water, in which one floats and swims, or watching human life enacted improbably by others on a stage, or seeing strange beasts in cages, or rolling elegant foods about the palate, or chasing after a ball, is pleasing. But, besides these simple pleasures, humanity has devised some so-called amusements which seem to depend for their reputations as entertainments less on pleasing sensations inflicted on the participants than on some convention which has ordained that these pursuits shall be held agreeable. It speaks well, perhaps, for the kindliness and amiability of the human race that most such pursuits are of a gregarious nature. Assembling together; dearly we love to do this. \u2018Neglect not the assembling of yourselves together,\u2019 says (I think) St. Paul somewhere; and it was a superfluous piece of admonition. Neglect of this will never be numbered among the many omissions of mankind. Seeing one another; meeting the others of our race; exchanging remarks; or merely observing in what particular garments they have elected to clothe themselves to- day; this is so nearly universal a custom that it has become dignified into an entertainment, and we issue to one another invitations to attend such gatherings.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We issue them and we accept them, and, when the appointed date arrives, we assume such of our clothes as we believe to be suitable to the gathering, and sally forth to the party of pleasure. Often, indeed usually, it is in the evening. Therefore we clothe ourselves in such garb as men and women have agreed, in their strange symbolism, to consider appropriate to the hours after eight o\u2019clock or so. And perhaps\u2014 who knows?\u2014 it is in the exercise of this savage and primitive conventionalism that a large part of the pleasure of an evening gathering consists. We are very primitive creatures, and the mere satisfaction of self-adornment, and of assuming for a particular occasion a particular set of clothes, may well tickle our sensibilities. Be that as it may, we arrive at our party dolled, so to speak, up, and find ourselves in a crowd of our fellow-creatures, all dolled up too. Now we are off. The party of pleasure has begun. We see friends and talk to them. But this we could do with greater comfort at our own homes or in theirs; this cannot, surely, be the promised pleasure. As a matter of fact, if you succeed in getting into a corner with a friend and talking, be sure you will be very soon torn asunder by an energetic hostess, whose motto is \u2018Keep them moving.\u2019 We are introduced to new acquaintances. This may, no doubt, be very agreeable. They may be persons you are glad to know. But it is doubtful whether your acquaintanceship will prosper very much to-night. It may well be that no topics suitable for discussion will present themselves to either of you at the moment of introduction. I know someone who says that she never can think of anything to say to persons introduced to her at a party except \u2018Do you like parties?\u2019 And that is too crude; it simply cannot be said. You must think of some more sophisticated remark. Having thought of it, you must launch it, in the peculiarly resonant pitch necessary to carry it above the clamour (for this clamour, which somewhat resembles the shrieking of a jazz band, is an essential accompaniment to a party, and part of the entertainment provided). A conversation will then ensue, and must be carried on until one or other of you either flags or breaks away, or until someone intervenes between you. One way and another, a very great deal gets said at a party. Let us hope that this is a good thing. It is apparent, anyhow, that the mere use of the tongue, quite apart from the words it utters, gives pleasure to many. If it gives you no pleasure, and if, further, you derive none from listening to the remarks of others, there is no need to converse. You had better then take up a position in a solitary corner (if possible on a chair, but this is a rare treat) and merely listen to the noise as to a concert, not endeavouring to form out of it sentences. As a matter of fact, if thus listened to, the noise of a party will be found a very interesting noise, containing a great variety of different sounds. If you are of those who like also to look at the clothes of others, you will, from this point of vantage, have a good view of these.</p>",

(3) Though so different, both species domesticated themselves by joining humans for their own benefit and providing benefits in return, thus ensuring their places beside humans.</p><p>(4) Dogs descended from wolves almost 41,000 years ago, when humans were hunter-gatherers. (5) Although some argue that domestication took place when humans captured and raised wolf pups as pets, far more likely is that some wolves began to follow human hunters. (6)&nbsp;Skilled at hunting in groups, they eventually assisted humans on the hunt, and, as their territorial interests merged with those of humans, they provided them with protection and warning against intruders. (7) This combination of usefulness, mutual interest, and similar social structure created a canine-human bond that has endured for millennia.</p><p>(8) Cats, whose ancestors are the wildcat <em>Felis silvestris lybica</em>, were domesticated much later, although earlier than once believed. (9) Archaeologists long assumed they were first domesticated about 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians, whose paintings were the first to depict domestic cats. (10) First was the discovery, in 2004, of a wildcat buried near a human skeleton in a 9,500-year-old grave in Cyprus. (11) Subsequently, genetic analysis confirmed the presence of <em>Felis silvestris lybica</em> in Turkey dating back 9,000 years and in southeastern Europe dating back 6,500 years. (12) Moreover, that these appearances coincided with the invention of agriculture was not accidental: as farmers began storing grain, rodents appeared in large numbers, and cats soon followed this supply of prey. (13) As with dogs thousands of years earlier, these cat ancestors both benefited from their contact with humans (in the form of a steady food supply) and benefited humans (by ridding farmers of rodents). (14) The recent discovery at the site of a 5,500-year-old Chinese farming village of cultivated millet isotopes in the bones of both rodents (who ate the millet) and cats (who ate the rodents) proves that agriculture brought us more than just food.</p>",

There are now 125 salmon operations along what is known as the Sunshine Coast. Teri Dawe of the Ocean Resource Conservation Alliance says the farms have been a disaster. Dawe says the salmon pens have triggered red-tide<sup>2</sup> outbreaks and polluted the foreshore with waste and the biocides, antibiotics and other medicines used to treat the fish.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cAn average salmon farm produces a volume of effluent equal to a town of 40,000 people,\u201d says Dawe. In addition, he says, the pens frequently break and the farm-bred salmon then make their way into rivers where they force out wild salmon\u2014a kind of genetic pollution.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cHistorically, unique salmon populations have evolved in each river. They are well adapted to the conditions in their own river,\u201d says Dawe. Genetically homogenizing the salmon makes the fish much more vulnerable to environmental change.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dawe says the farmed salmon are also responsible for infecting wild salmon with a variety of diseases\u2014including sea lice, which deform the fish, and bacterial kidney disease. Fish farmers normally expect losses from disease of 25 to 30 per cent. Dawe says if salmon are to be farmed they should be raised in tanks on land and all the effluent should be treated.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cI still wouldn\u2019t eat farmed salmon,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut if others want to, that\u2019s their business.\u201d</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Bruce McKay, a marine mammal researcher with Greenpeace,<sup>3</sup> says a parasitic fluke from a salmon hatchery in Sweden spread to Norway several years ago and has now turned up in 27 rivers.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cThe entire wild salmon population in Norway is now at risk,\u201d he warns. \u201cI firmly believe the success of marine aquaculture as an industry will be at the expense of existing fisheries.\u201d</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Gary Spiller, a fisheries consultant who worked for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Asia, says disease is common where fish farms are not closely regulated. In 1987 Taiwan became the largest prawn producer in the world. A year later disease struck and production dropped by 70 per cent. The industry never recovered. Spiller says Taiwan was just the first to crash. The Philippine prawn industry is currently suffering from disease problems and experts predict prawn farms in Thailand will be hit next.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The Brundtland Commission, which endorsed the promise of aquaculture,<sup>4</sup> noted that the major constraint to expansion of the industry is science. \u201cBecause marine biologists have not been able to get some commercial species to reproduce in captivity, fish farmers are still largely dependent on the gathering of eggs or the capture of fingerlings.\u201d</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Fisheries scientists across the globe are now working to overcome that technical barrier to expansion of the industry. Their efforts are characterized by industry supporters as a race against hunger: if natural stocks of fish are not enough to meet demand, then fish farmers will come to the rescue. That line of reasoning troubles many. Philippine prawn farms are not producing food for the hungry, nor are they providing employment for hundreds of jobless sugar workers.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>At last count there were more than 30,000 prawn farms in 40 countries. Many were carved out of mangrove swamps, which protected shorelines from erosion and were the nurseries for thousands of marine organisms.</p><p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Others were simply schemes that allowed the wealthy to privatize what had previously been a public resource used by subsistence farmers and fisherfolk. Researcher Wolfgang Harris studied two villages in Java and found that as prawn and fish farming expanded so did the landholdings of the wealthy. The losers were villagers who, for generations, had been cultivating fish in small ponds for local consumption.</p><p><em>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The environmental problems posed by attempts to assume nature\u2019s responsibility for managing fish stocks are even more troubling. Ray Hilborn, a biologist at the University of Washington, says there is a danger that science will provide a smokescreen for environmental degradation. Hilborn says that along the west coast of North America fisheries managers have responded to salmon habitat loss and over-fishing by developing hatcheries. Salmon eggs are harvested in the wild, hatched and then reintroduced into depleted rivers.</p><p><em>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>According to Hilborn the same tactic is now being suggested for herring, tuna, abalone and giant clams. Money that should be spent on habitat protection or restoration is instead being spent on restocking. Hilborn claims this approach both encourages careless exploitation and reduces species diversity.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>ITT Water & Wastewater, a company that developed water technology products, including products for raising aquatic animals in a controlled environment<br><sup>2</sup>toxic algae bloom<br><sup>3</sup>an international non-governmental environmental organization<br><sup>4</sup>rearing aquatic animals or growing aquatic plants for food<br></p></small></div>",

These are the so-called Big Five mass extinctions, commonly defined as any event in which more than half of the earth\u2019s species go extinct in fewer than a million years or so. We now know that many of these mass extinctions seem to have happened much more quickly. Thanks to fine-scale geochronology,<sup>1</sup> we know that some of the most extreme die-offs in earth history lasted only a few thousand years, at the very most, and may have been much quicker. A more qualitative way to describe something like this is Armageddon.<sup>2</sup></p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The most famous member of this gloomy fraternity is the End-Cretaceous mass extinction, which notably took out the (nonbird) dinosaurs 66 million years ago. But the End-Cretaceous is only the most <em>recent</em> mass extinction in the history of life. The volcanic doomsday whose stony embers I saw exposed in the cliffs next to Manhattan<sup>3</sup>\u2014a disaster that brought down an alternate universe of distant crocodile relatives and global coral reef systems\u2014struck 135 million years before the death of the dinosaurs. This disaster and the three other major mass extinctions that preceded it are invisible, for the most part, in the public imagination, long overshadowed by the downfall of <em>T. rex</em>. This isn\u2019t entirely without reason. For one thing, dinosaurs are the most charismatic characters in the fossil record, celebrities of earth history that paleontologists who work on earlier, more neglected periods scoff at as preening oversized monsters. As such, dinosaurs hog most of the popular press spared for paleontology. In addition, the dinosaurs were wiped out in spectacular fashion, with their final moments punctuated by the impact of a 6-mile-long asteroid in Mexico.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But if it <em>was</em> a space rock that did in the dinosaurs, it seems to have been a unique disaster. Some astronomers outside the field push the idea that periodic asteroid strikes caused each of the planet\u2019s other four mass extinctions, but this hypothesis has virtually no support in the fossil record. In the past three decades, geologists have scoured the fossil record looking for evidence of devastating asteroid impacts at those mass extinctions, and have come up empty. The most dependable and frequent administrators of global catastrophe, it turns out, are dramatic changes to the climate and the ocean, driven by the forces of geology itself. The three biggest mass extinctions in the past 300 million years are all associated with giant floods of lava on a continental scale\u2014the sorts of eruptions that beggar the imagination. Life on earth is resilient, but not infinitely so: the same volcanoes that are capable of turning whole continents inside out can also produce climatic and oceanic chaos worthy of the apocalypse. In these rare eruptive cataclysms the atmosphere becomes supercharged with volcanic carbon dioxide, and during the worst mass extinction of all time, the planet was rendered a hellish, rotting sepulcher,<sup>4</sup> with hot, acidifying oceans starved of oxygen.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But in other earlier mass extinctions, it might have been neither volcanoes nor asteroids at fault. Instead, some geologists say that plate tectonics, and perhaps even biology itself, conspired to suck up CO<sub>2</sub> and poison the oceans. While continental-scale volcanism sends CO<sub>2</sub> soaring, in these earlier, somewhat more mysterious extinctions, carbon dioxide might have instead plummeted, imprisoning the earth in an icy crypt.<sup>5</sup> Rather than spectacular collisions with other heavenly bodies, it has been these internal shocks to the earth system that have most frequently knocked the planet off course. Much of the planet\u2019s misfortune, it seems, is homegrown.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Luckily, these uber-catastrophes are comfortingly rare, having struck only five times in the more than half a billion years since complex life emerged (occurring, roughly, 445, 374, 252, 201, and 66 million years ago). But it\u2019s a history that has echoes in our own world\u2014which is undergoing changes not seen for tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, of years. \u201c[It\u2019s] pretty clear that times of high carbon dioxide\u2014and especially times when carbon dioxide levels rapidly rose\u2014coincided with the mass extinctions,\u201d writes University of Washington paleontologist and End-Permean mass extinction expert Peter Ward. \u201cHere is the driver of extinction.\u201d</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>chronology as indicated by geologic data<br><sup>2</sup>a final battle between good and evil at the end of the world<br><sup>3</sup>The Palisades cliffs along the Hudson River are composed of magma that once fueled hemisphere-wide volcanic eruptions.<br><sup>4</sup>tomb<br><sup>5</sup>burial chamber</p></small></div>",

Writing is communication. You need other people to let you know whether you\u2019re communicating what you think you are and whether you\u2019re doing it in ways that are not only accessible and entertaining, but as compelling as you can make them. In other words, you need to know that you\u2019re telling a good story. You want to be the writer who keeps readers up late at night, not the one who drives them off to watch television. Workshops and classes are rented readers\u2014rented audiences\u2014for your work. Learn from the comments, questions, and suggestions of both the teacher and the class. These relative strangers are more likely to tell you the truth about your work than are your friends and family who may not want to hurt or offend you. One tiresome truth they might tell you, for instance, is that you need to take a grammar class. If they say this, listen. Take the class. Vocabulary and grammar are your primary tools. They\u2019re most effectively used, even most effectively abused, by people who understand them. No computer program, no friend or employee can take the place of a sound knowledge of your tools.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Write. Write every day. Write whether you feel like writing or not. Choose a time of day. Perhaps you can get up an hour earlier, stay up an hour later, give up an hour of recreation, or even give up your lunch hour. If you can\u2019t think of anything in your chosen genre, keep a journal. You should be keeping one anyway. Journal writing helps you to be more observant of your world, and a journal is a good place to store story ideas for later projects.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Revise your writing until it\u2019s as good as you can make it. All the reading, the writing, and the classes should help you do this. Check your writing, your research (never neglect your research), and the physical appearance of your manuscript. Let nothing substandard slip through. If you notice something that needs fixing, fix it, no excuses. There will be plenty that\u2019s wrong that you won\u2019t catch. Don\u2019t make the mistake of ignoring flaws that are obvious to you. The moment you find yourself saying, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s good enough.\u201d Stop. Go back. Fix the flaw. Make a habit of doing your best.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Submit your work for publication. First research the markets that interest you. Seek out and study the books or magazines of publishers to whom you want to sell. Then submit your work. If the idea of doing this scares you, fine. Go ahead and be afraid. But send your work out anyway. If it\u2019s rejected, send it out again, and again. Rejections are painful, but inevitable. They\u2019re every writer\u2019s rite of passage. Don\u2019t give up on a piece of work that you can\u2019t sell. You may be able to sell it later to new publications or to new editors of old publications. At worst, you should be able to learn from your rejected work. You may even be able to use all or part of it in a new work. One way or another, writers can use, or at least learn from, everything.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Here are some potential impediments for you to forget about:</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>First forget <span>inspiration</span>. Habit is more dependable. Habit will sustain you whether you\u2019re inspired or not. Habit will help you finish and polish your stories. Inspiration won\u2019t. Habit is persistence in practice.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Forget <span>talent</span>. If you have it, fine. Use it. If you don\u2019t have it, it doesn\u2019t matter. As habit is more dependable than inspiration, continued learning is more dependable than talent. Never let pride or laziness prevent you from learning, improving your work, changing its direction when necessary. Persistence is essential to any writer\u2014the persistence to finish your work, to keep writing in spite of rejection, to keep reading, studying, submitting work for sale. But stubbornness, the refusal to change unproductive behavior or to revise unsalable work can be lethal to your writing hopes.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Finally, don\u2019t worry about imagination. You have all the imagination you need, and all the reading, journal writing, and learning you will be doing will stimulate it. Play with your ideas. Have fun with them. Don\u2019t worry about being silly or outrageous or wrong. So much of writing is fun. It\u2019s first letting your interests and your imagination take you anywhere at all. Once you\u2019re able to do that, you\u2019ll have more ideas than you can use.</p></div></div></div>",

        "text": "<div><p><em>(The following passage is an excerpt from the introduction to a book published in 1961.)</em></p><div><div><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As we learn more about the sea through the combined studies of many specialists a new concept that is gradually taking form will almost certainly be strengthened. Even a decade or so ago it was the fashion to speak of the abyss as a place of eternal calm, its black recesses undisturbed by any movement of water more active than a slowly creeping current, a place isolated from the surface and from the very different world of the shallow sea. This picture is rapidly being replaced by one that shows the deep sea as a place of movement and change, an idea that is far more exciting and that possesses deep significance for some of the most pressing problems of our time.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the new and more dynamic concept, the floor of the deep sea is shaped by racing turbidity currents or mud flows that pour down the slopes of the ocean basins at high speed; it is visited by submarine landslides and stirred by internal tides. The crests and ridges of some of the undersea mountains are swept bare of sediments by currents whose action, in the words of geologist Bruce Heezen, is comparable to \u201csnow avalanches in the Alps (which) sweep down and smother the relief of the lower slopes.\u201d</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Far from being isolated from the continents and the shallow seas that surround them, the abyssal plains are now known to receive sediments from the margins of the continents. The effect of the turbidity currents, over the vast stretches of geologic time, is to fill the trenches and the hollows of the abyssal floor with sediment. This concept helps us understand certain hitherto puzzling occurrences. Why, for example, have deposits of sand\u2014surely a product of coastal erosion and the grinding of surf\u2014appeared on the mid-ocean floor? Why have sediments at the mouths of submarine canyons, where they communicate with the abyss, been found to contain such reminders of the land as bits of wood and leaves, and why are there sands containing nuts, twigs, and the bark of trees even farther out on the plains of the abyss? In the powerful downrush of sediment-laden currents, triggered by storms or floods or earthquakes, we now have a mechanism that accounts for these once mysterious facts.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Although the beginnings of our present concept of a dynamic sea go back perhaps several decades, it is only the superb instruments of the past ten years that have allowed us to glimpse the hidden movements of ocean waters. Now we suspect that all those dark regions between the surface and the bottom are stirred by currents. Even such mighty surface currents as the Gulf Stream are not quite what we supposed them to be. Instead of a broad and steadily flowing river of water, the Gulf Stream is now found to consist of narrow, racing tongues of warm water that curl back in swirls and eddies. And below the surface currents are others unlike them, running at their own speeds, in their own direction, with their own volume. And below these are still others. Photographs of the sea bottom taken at great depths formerly supposed to be eternally still show ripple marks, a sign that moving waters are sorting over sediments and carrying away the finer particles.

        "text": "<div><p><em>(The following passage is excerpted from the preface of a book published in 2008 by a geography professor</em><span>.)</span></p><div><div><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Numerous books and articles published in recent years argue, explicitly as well as implicitly, that the human world today is so mobile, so interconnected, and so integrative that it is, in one prominent and much-repeated assessment, \u201cflat.\u201d Ancient and durable obstacles are no more, interaction is global, free trade rules the globe, migration is ubiquitous,<sup>1</sup> and the flow of ideas (and money and jobs) is so pervasive that geography, in the perspective of more than one observer, \u201cis history.\u201d The notion that place continues to play a key role in shaping humanity\u2019s still-variegated mosaic is seen as obsolete, even offensive and deterministic. Choice, not constraint, is the mantra<sup>2</sup> of the new flat-world proponents. Join the \u201cforces of flattening\u201d and you will enjoy the benefits. Don\u2019t, and you will fall off the edge. The option is yours.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But is it? From the vantage point of a high-floor room in the Shanghai Hyatt, the Mumbai Oberoi, or the Dubai Hilton,<sup>3</sup> or from a business-class window seat on Singapore Airlines, the world seems flat indeed. Millions of world-flatteners move every day from hotel lobby to airport limo to first-class lounge, laptop in hand, uploading, outsourcing, offshoring as they travel, adjusting the air conditioning as they go. They are changing the world, these modern nomads, and they are, in many ways, improving it\u2014depending of course on one\u2019s definition of progress. But are they invariably agents of access and integration? Are they lowering the barriers to participation or raising the stakes against it? Have their influence and impact overpowered the imperatives of place, so that their very mobility symbolizes a confirmed irrelevance of location?</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Not yet. The Earth, physically as well as culturally, still is very rough terrain, and in crucial ways its regional compartments continue to trap billions in circumstances that spell disadvantage. The power of place and the fate of people are linked by many strands ranging from physical area and natural environment to durable culture and local tradition. This book, therefore, views a world in which progress toward convergence is countered by stagnation, even setbacks. Various constituencies of the comparatively prosperous global core are walling off their affluent realms from intrusion by poorer globals, hardening a division between core and periphery that exacerbates contrasts and stokes conflicts. The near-global diffusion of various forms of English as a first or second language is promoting a cultural convergence, but the radicalization of religions has the opposite effect. The distribution of health and well-being shows troubling signs of inequity and reversal. Because people continue to congregate in places of high environmental risk, especially in the crowded periphery, hundreds of millions find themselves in continuing jeopardy (as the 2004 tsunami,<sup>4</sup> in the absence of coordinated warning systems, tragically confirmed). Inevitably, places of costly historic and current conflict take their toll as the \u201cinternational community\u201d stands by without effective intervention, another form of jeopardy that afflicts the destinies of millions. And males and females in the same locales have widely varying experiences, their destinies diverging in sometimes agonizing ways. Even in the world\u2019s cities, where the \u201crising tide lifts all boats\u201d promise of globalization should be especially evident, power creates a high-relief topography of privilege and privation. Nor is the world\u2019s divisive political stockade<sup>5</sup> likely to be flattened anytime soon. Even as states try to join in unions and associations, their provinces and regions nurture nationalisms working the other way. The power of place still holds the vast majority of us in its thrall.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Of course, the question is not whether the world is flat. Thomas Friedman, who coined the phrase, concedes that he realizes \u201cthat the world is not flat. Don\u2019t worry, I know . . . I have engaged in literary license in titling [my] book to draw attention . . . .\u201d It is the <span>process</span> of \u201cflattening\u201d on which Friedman wants to focus through his provocative title, \u201cthe single most important trend in the world today,\u201d that is at issue. And in certain respects the global playing field <span>is</span> leveling, but in other ways the reverse appears to be true. Notions of a flat world raise expectations of growing access and increasing opportunity that are mantras of globalization but are all too often at variance with reality. Powerful forces, natural as well as human, slow the flattening process in a contest that will determine the future of the planet.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>widespread<br><sup>2</sup>slogan<br><sup>3</sup>luxury hotels<br><sup>4</sup>In December 2004, a series of immense ocean waves hit the coasts of several South and Southeast Asian countries, causing catastrophic destruction in the region.<br><sup>5</sup>enclosure</p></small></div></div></div>",

        "text": "<div><p><em>(The following passage is excerpted from an essay by a nineteenth-century American author.)</em></p><div><div><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I remember well the remark made to me once by one of my teachers\u2014and a very good teacher, too, who nevertheless did not see what her own observation ought to have suggested. \u201cSchool-children,\u201d she said, \u201cregard teachers as their natural enemies.\u201d The thought which it would have been logical to suppose would have followed this observation is, that if children in general are possessed of that notion, it is because there is a great deal in the teacher\u2019s treatment of them which runs counter to the child\u2019s nature: that possibly this is so, not because of natural cussedness on the part of the child, but because of inapplicability of the knowledge taught, or the manner of teaching it, or both, to the mental and physical needs of the child. I am quite sure no such thought entered my teacher\u2019s mind,\u2014at least regarding the system of knowledge to be imposed; being a sensible woman, she perhaps occasionally admitted to herself that she might make mistakes in applying the rules, but that the body of knowledge to be taught was indispensable, and must somehow be injected into children\u2019s heads, under threat of punishment, if necessary, I am sure she never questioned. It did not occur to her any more than to most teachers, that the first business of an educator should be to find out what are the needs, aptitudes, and tendencies of children, before he or she attempts to outline a body of knowledge to be taught, or rules for teaching it. It does not occur to them that the child\u2019s question, \u201cWhat do I have to learn that for?\u201d is a perfectly legitimate question; and if the teacher cannot answer it to the child\u2019s satisfaction, something is wrong either with the thing taught, or with the teaching; either the thing taught is out of rapport with the child\u2019s age, or his natural tendencies, or his condition of development; or the method by which it is taught repels him, disgusts him, or at best fails to interest him.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When a child says, \u201cI don\u2019t see why I have to know that; I can\u2019t remember it anyway,\u201d he is voicing a very reasonable protest. Of course, there are plenty of instances of wilful shirking, where a little effort can overcome the slackness of memory; but every teacher who is honest enough to reckon with himself knows he cannot give a sensible reason why things are to be taught which have so little to do with the child\u2019s life that to-morrow, or the day after examination, they will be forgotten; things which he himself could not remember were he not repeating them year in and year out, as a matter of his trade. And every teacher who has thought at all for himself about the essential nature of the young humanity he is dealing with, knows that six hours of daily herding and in-penning of young, active bodies and limbs, accompanied by the additional injunction that no feet are to be shuffled, no whispers exchanged, and no paper wads thrown, is a frightful violation of all the laws of young life. Any gardener who should attempt to raise healthy, beautiful, and fruitful plants by outraging all those plants\u2019 instinctive wants and searchings, would meet as his reward\u2014sickly plants, ugly plants, sterile plants, dead plants. He will not do it; he will watch very carefully to see whether they like much sunlight, or considerable shade, whether they thrive on much water or get drowned in it, whether they like sandy soil, or fat mucky soil; the plant itself will indicate to him when he is doing the right thing. And every gardener will watch for indications with great anxiety. If he finds the plant revolts against his experiments, he will desist at once, and try something else; if he finds it thrives, he will emphasize the particular treatment so long as it seems beneficial. But what he will surely not do, will be to prepare a certain area of ground all just alike, with equal chances of sun and amount of moisture in every part, and then plant everything together without discrimination,\u2014mighty close together!\u2014saying beforehand, \u201cIf plants don\u2019t want to thrive on this, they ought to want to; and if they are stubborn about it, they must be made to.\u201d</p></div></div></div>",

(2)&nbsp;The movement concentrated primarily on the rights of agricultural workers but also on larger matters affecting the Mexican American community at the time. (3)&nbsp;Inspired by these efforts, a number of Mexican American artists turned to printmaking as a form of artistic expression.</p><p>(4)&nbsp;Some printmakers looked to Mexico\u2019s illustrious past, while others focused on the present as inspiration for their pieces. (5)&nbsp;For instance, Xavier Viramontes\u2019 print <em>Boycott Grapes, Support the United Farm Workers Union</em> was inspired by an initiative to get consumers to stop buying grapes in support of farm laborers in California. (6)&nbsp;Viramontes\u2019 poster shows a determined-looking Aztec (a powerful civilization that flourished in Central Mexico in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries) deity squeezing a bunch of grapes. (7)&nbsp;Viramontes\u2019 imagery highlights the strength of the boycott movement while it simultaneously promotes the campaign\u2019s message.</p><p>(8)&nbsp;Other works are less overtly activist in nature and instead incorporate cultural traditions and historical figures to celebrate the artists\u2019 heritage. (9)&nbsp;For instance, two prints created by Ester Hernandez in 1987 and 2001 show singer and guitar player Lydia Mendoza, who is known as the mother of Tejano music. (10)&nbsp;Three other prints are made by the same artist. (11)&nbsp;Frida Kahlo is a painter from Mexico, and she is depicted on those three prints. (12)&nbsp;Other notable prints include numerous posters inspired by <em>D\u00eda de los Muertos</em>, an important Mexican holiday, and by prominent figures from Mexican history such as military leaders Francisco \u201cPancho\u201d Villa and Emiliano Zapata. (13)&nbsp;Taken together, such works remind viewers of the rich legacy of the Mexican American community.</p><p>(14)&nbsp;Art critics long tended to give little attention to the prints inspired by the Chicano movement, but this trend is changing. (15)&nbsp;In 2020, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., presented a large exhibition of such prints, showing that they are beginning to get the notoriety they deserve as an iconic part of the history of visual arts and Mexican American culture in the US.</p>",

And the most mischievous form of feminine silliness is the literary form, because it tends to confirm the popular prejudice against the more solid education of women.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When men see girls wasting their time in consultations about bonnets and ball dresses, and in giggling or sentimental love-confidences, or middle-aged women mismanaging their children, and solacing themselves with acrid gossip, they can hardly help saying, \u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, let girls be better educated; let them have some better objects of thought\u2014some more solid occupations.\u201d But after a few hours\u2019 conversation with an oracular<sup>1</sup> literary woman, or a few hours\u2019 reading of her books, they are likely enough to say, \u201cAfter all, when a woman gets some knowledge, see what use she makes of it! Her knowledge remains acquisition instead of passing into culture; instead of being subdued into modesty and simplicity by a larger acquaintance with thought and fact, she has a feverish consciousness of her attainments; she keeps a sort of mental pocket-mirror, and is continually looking in it at her own \u2018intellectuality;\u2019 she spoils the taste of one\u2019s muffin by questions of metaphysics; \u2018puts down\u2019 men at a dinner-table with her superior information; and seizes the opportunity of a soir\u00e9e<sup>2</sup> to catechise<sup>3</sup> us on the vital question of the relation between mind and matter. And then, look at her writings! She mistakes vagueness for depth, bombast for eloquence, and affectation for originality; she struts on one page, rolls her eyes on another, grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth. She may have read many writings of great men, and a few writings of great women; but she is as unable to discern the difference between her own style and theirs as a Yorkshireman is to discern the difference between his own English and a Londoner\u2019s: rhodomontade<sup>4</sup> is the native accent of her intellect. No\u2014the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble a soil to bear much tillage;<sup>5</sup> it is only fit for the very lightest crops.\u201d</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is true that the men who come to such a decision on such very superficial and imperfect observation may not be among the wisest in the world; but we have not now to contest their opinion\u2014we are only pointing out how it is unconsciously encouraged by many women who have volunteered themselves as representatives of the feminine intellect. We do not believe that a man was ever strengthened in such an opinion by associating with a woman of true culture, whose mind had absorbed her knowledge instead of being absorbed by it. A really cultured woman, like a really cultured man, is all the simpler and the less obtrusive for her knowledge; it has made her see herself and her opinions in something like just proportions; she does not make it a pedestal from which she flatters herself that she commands a complete view of men and things, but makes it a point of observation from which to form a right estimate of herself. She neither spouts poetry nor quotes Cicero<sup>6</sup> on slight provocation; not because she thinks that a sacrifice must be made to the prejudices of men, but because that mode of exhibiting her memory and Latinity<sup>7</sup> does not present itself to her as edifying or graceful. She does not write books to confound philosophers, perhaps because she is able to write books that delight them. In conversation she is the least formidable of women, because she understands you, without wanting to make you aware that you can\u2019t understand her.

We\u2019d come to them only seconds after the witching hour of noon, but we were too late. There was no one to open the lock for us; <em>l\u2019\u00e9clusi\u00e8re</em><sup>1</sup> was at lunch, and after lunch she would lay herself down, close her eyes, and nap. At two, but not before, she would emerge refreshed from her square granite house and set the great cogs in motion.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We tied the boat up to a spindly bush beside the towpath and waited. And waited. It was high haying season, but the fields lay empty of farmers. The roads lay empty of trucks. France lunched, and then slept. So did Spain. So did much of the civilized world.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If we\u2019d been differently nurtured we too would have taken a nap, but we were Americans, condemned from the age of four to trudge through our sleepless days. Americans are afraid of naps.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Napping is too luxurious, too sybaritic,<sup>2</sup> too unproductive, and it\u2019s free; pleasures for which we don\u2019t pay make us anxious. Besides, it seems to be a natural inclination. Those who get paid to investigate such things have proved that people deprived of daylight and their wristwatches, with no notion of whether it was night or day, sink blissfully asleep in midafternoon as regular as clocks. Fighting off natural inclinations is a major Puritan<sup>3</sup> virtue, and nothing that feels that good can be respectable.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>They may have a point there. Certainly the process of falling asleep in the afternoon is quite different from bedtime sleep. Whether this is physiological or merely a by-product of guilt, it\u2019s a blatantly sensual experience, a voluptuous surrender, akin to the euphoric swoon of the heroine in a vampire movie. For the self-controlled, it\u2019s frightening\u2014how far down am I falling? will I ever climb back? The sleep itself has a different texture. It\u2019s blacker, thicker, more intense, and works faster. Fifteen minutes later the napper pops back to the surface as from time travel, bewildered to find that it\u2019s only ten of two instead of centuries later.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Like skydiving, napping takes practice; the first few tries are scary.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The American nap is even scarier because it\u2019s unilateral. Sleeping Frenchmen are surrounded by sleeping compatriots, but Americans who lie down by day stiffen with the thought of the busy world rushing past. There we lie, visible and vulnerable on our day lit bed, ready to cut the strings and sink into the dark, swirling, almost sexual currents of the impending doze, but what will happen in our absence? Our stocks will fall; our employees will mutiny and seize the helm; our clients will tiptoe away to competitors. Even the housewife, taking advantage of the afternoon lull, knows at the deepest level of consciousness that the phone is about to ring.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And of course, for those of us with proper jobs, there\u2019s the problem of finding a bed. Some corporations, in their concern for their employees\u2019 health and fitness, provide gym rooms where we can commit strenuous exercise at lunchtime, but where are our beds? In Japan, the productivity wonder of the industrialized world, properly run companies maintain a nap room wherein the workers may refresh themselves. Even in America, rumor has it, the costly CEOs of giant corporations work sequestered in private suites, guarded by watchpersons, mainly so they can curl up unseen to sharpen their predatory powers with a quick snooze. A couple of recent presidents famous for their all-night energies kept up the pace by means of naps. Other presidents, less famous for energy, slept by day and night; woe to the unwary footstep that wakened Coolidge<sup>4</sup> in the afternoon.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This leaves the rest of us lackeys bolt upright, toughing it out, trying to focus on the computer screen, from time to time snatching our chins up off our collarbones and glancing furtively around to see if we were noticed. The modern office isn\u2019t designed for privacy, and most of our cubicles have no doors to close, only gaps in the portable partitions. Lay our heads down on the desk at the appropriate hour and we\u2019re exposed to any passing snitch who strolls the halls enforcing alertness. It\u2019s a wonder they don\u2019t walk around ringing bells and blowing trumpets from one till three. American employers do not see the afternoon forty winks as refreshing the creative wellsprings of mere employees.

(2)&nbsp;However, because of the phenomenon known as confirmation bias, logical decision making is rarely so simple. (3)&nbsp;Confirmation bias, which describes the human tendency to interpret new information in a way that supports our preexisting beliefs, makes people tend to accept information that confirms what they already believe and reject information that undermines those beliefs.</p><p>(4) Research has repeatedly demonstrated just how prevalent this phenomenon is in the world. (5) Confirmation bias has been found to affect the decisions of doctors, judges, and jurors. (6) It has even been shown to affect memory. (7) In a classic experiment, students who watched their schools compete in a football game subsequently remembered the adversary\u2019s team performing worse than their own: confirmation bias caused the students, who already believed in their own school\u2019s superiority, to interpret what they had seen as support for their preexisting beliefs. (8) Confirmation bias has also been shown to affect completely inconsequential decisions, as in experiments involving what direction dots are moving in or the average size of a number series. (9) Here, too, subjects\u2019 interpretations were found to be affected by decisions they had already made about what they were being asked to evaluate.</p><p>(10) Confirmation bias does admittedly have its uses: it can, for example, increase the efficiency with which we process information and also protect us against information that might be damaging to our self-esteem. (11) But when the stakes are high, the risks of making biased decisions are simply too great. (12) An example of a high-stakes situation would be when jurors are deliberating a defendant\u2019s fate. (13) Fortunately, there are techniques, like those used by Warren Buffett (born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1930) when he makes his financial decisions, that can minimize the risks of confirmation bias. (14) The first is to be aware that our decisions may be affected by our tendency toward confirmation bias. (15) The second is to test our beliefs by seeking out points of view that differ from our own.</p>",

There was, however, an essential requirement: Each and every action recounted had to be verified by at least one witness. That verification ensured the truth. To truthfully describe one\u2019s action in combat through the forum of ceremony was not considered bragging because the recounting\u2014the story of the action\u2014was a gift. It became part of the identity and the lore of the storyteller\u2019s warrior society, and it served to strengthen the entire village\u2014not to mention that the deed recounted served as an example for young men to emulate.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Most men who did the waktoglaka did not repeat the story unless asked because they realized the value of humility. While exploits in the arena of combat were the way to establish and enhance a good reputation and gain status in the community, lack of appropriate humility was a sure way to taint one\u2019s reputation and erode hard-won status. In other words, once the battle was over it was time to be humble.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>To traditional Lakota, humility was the one virtue that enhanced other virtues. To be generous was good, for example, as long as one did not call attention to his or her generosity. Anything good that was done or said with humility carried more impact. According to all the stories, one of the most humble of all Lakota was Crazy Horse.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Crazy Horse was an Oglala Lakota. The Oglala, which means \u201cto scatter one\u2019s own,\u201d were (and are) one of the seven Lakota groups. His is one of the most familiar names to emerge from the turbulent nineteenth century in the American West. In western American history, written by Euro-Americans, he is popularly regarded as the conqueror of both General George Crook and Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. On June 17, 1876, he led seven hundred to nine hundred Lakota and Cheyenne warriors and stopped Crook\u2019s northward advance at the Battle of the Rosebud, on the Rosebud River in what is now north central Wyoming. Eight days later, one thousand to twelve hundred Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors under his leadership, as well as the able leadership of several other notable Lakota battlefield leaders, defeated Custer\u2019s Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Crazy Horse was thirty-six years old at the time, and his combat experience and leadership helped to thwart\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014the United States Army\u2019s grand plan of 1876 to capture and herd all the Lakota onto reservations once and for all. But we Lakota don\u2019t remember him primarily because he defeated Crook or Custer; we remember him because\u2014in spite of his larger-than-life achievements on the field of battle\u2014he was a humble man.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Crazy Horse was born to be a warrior and a leader. He had an ability to stay calm in the midst of chaos and confusion, and to lead by example. In the Lakota society of his day the arena of combat provided opportunities for fighting men to display skill and courage. Acts of bravery on the battlefield earned them honors within their warrior societies and status in the society at large. Many men who achieved a following as combat leaders also went on to become political leaders as well, such as the Hunkpapa Lakota Sitting Bull.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As a matter of fact, Crazy Horse\u2019s steadiness under fire earned him his first adult name, prior to Crazy Horse. Because he had a habit of dismounting in the midst of fighting, then kneeling beside his war horse to take deliberate aim at the enemy, he became known as His Horse Stands in Sight. Such conduct earned him more combat honors by his early twenties than most men achieved in an entire lifetime. He was known far and wide for his daring and recklessness in combat, but also for his ability to make good tactical decisions. If anyone earned the right to participate in the waktoglaka ceremony, it was he. But according to all the stories handed down about him he never did.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For all of his life Crazy Horse was painfully shy and probably spoke in public only twice. Though he was entitled to wear the symbols of his many achievements on the battlefield\u2014eagle feathers\u2014he was known to dress plainly. If he wore any decoration at all it was usually a single feather.</p></div></div></div>",

The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twisted pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt. There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement. A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticize work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life\u2019s realities\u2014all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain to think, of superiority but of weakness. They mark the men unfit to bear their part painfully in the stern strife of living, who seek, in the affection of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves in their own weakness. The role is easy; there is none easier, save only the role of the man who sneers alike at both criticism and performance.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world. Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows. Still less room is there for those who deride or slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop,<sup>1</sup> or voluptuary.<sup>2</sup> There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength. It is war-worn Hotspur,<sup>3</sup> spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who \u201cbut for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier.\u201d</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>a vain man devoted to his clothing and appearance<br><sup>2</sup>a person interested in material wealth and physical satisfaction<br><sup>3</sup>a character from Shakespeare\u2019s <em>King Henry IV, Part I</em> who leads a rebellion against the King</p></small></div></div></div>",

What was known twenty years ago was even more imperfect, and the science of fifty years ago hardly worth knowing. Using a little imagination, we can ask what will become of the science of today, some twenty or thirty years from now? Unless the rate of scientific advance shows a notable slacking off (and there are no signs of this) our best knowledge of today will become decidedly frowsy<sup>1</sup>.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Since scientists have such overweening confidence in their own ability\u2014in their collective ability, that is to say\u2014it is no small wonder that they make no attempt to teach what are the limitations of science, for they hardly recognize any.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yet there may be limits to what science can do. Consider this question: Can science disprove ghosts? In the supremely confident period, toward the end of the last century, when it was supposed that there was a conflict between Science and Religion, and Science was rapidly winning, it was the mark of an educated man to say \u201cScience has proved that there are no such things as ghosts, they are merely the superstitions of the unenlightened.\u201d Education is always behind the times, and much the same attitude is prevalent today; you can still hear people say, \u201cSurely, science has proved that there are no ghosts.\u201d And yet, is that so? Suppose, just suppose for the sake of argument, that ghosts can occasionally appear when the psychological conditions are just right, and suppose, what might quite well be true, that one necessary condition for the appearance of a ghost is the <em>absence</em> of a scientist: well then, \u201cScience\u201d (that is to say, scientists) would go on investigating ghost after ghost, and would \u201cdisprove\u201d every one of them, and yet ghosts would continue to appear whenever the scientists were not looking.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is a simple case, perhaps not a very important one, illustrating the impossibility of proving anything negative by the scientific method. At least it is enough to show that science is not infallible, and if science has any more serious defects than the inability to perceive an occasional spook in the corner, it is of the utmost importance that citizens, generally, should know what they are. Yet this sort of knowledge is very conspicuously absent from the populace at large and from the curriculums of institutes of learning. Non-scientists don\u2019t even know what science <em>can</em> do; scientists are so obsessed with the past successes and future possibilities of their own specialty that they have no idea what the proper field of science in general is and no recognition that there are any limits. What they can\u2019t do, some other scientists, presumably, can do, so that they come to think that science with a capital \u201cS\u201d\u2014or rather its concentrated and distilled essence, the Scientific Method\u2014is the universal cure-all for mankind.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>They are wrong, for science is not a cure-all. The claims of the science fiends are preposterously exaggerated. Science has many important limitations, which will appear throughout this book in ever-increasing number. The idea that science is infallible and beyond criticism is a delusion, and even a dangerous one. The teaching of science only perpetuates this delusion, for it is always taught by scientists, who are so busy keeping up with science that they can never look at it from the outside. What with scientists who are so deep in science that they cannot see it, and non-scientists who are too overawed to express an opinion, hardly anyone is able to recognize science for what it is, the great Sacred Cow<sup>2</sup> of our time.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>John Dewey, a worshiper in the temple of science, said \u201cthe future of our civilization depends on the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind.\u201d But perhaps there is more truth in an old wisecrack of Oliver Wendell Holmes: \u201cScience is a good piece of furniture for a man to have in an upper chamber provided he has common sense on the ground floor.\u201d</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>stale<br><sup>2</sup>one that is often unreasonably immune from criticism or opposition</p></small></div></div></div>",

Day by day throughout the passage, and thenceforward across all the States, and on to the shores of the Pacific, this knowledge grew more clear and melancholy. Emigration, from a word of the most cheerful import, came to sound most dismally in my ear. There is nothing more agreeable to picture and nothing more pathetic to behold. The abstract idea, as conceived at home, is hopeful and adventurous. A young man, you fancy, scorning restraints and helpers, issues forth into life, that great battle, to fight for his own hand. The most pleasant stories of ambition, of difficulties overcome, and of ultimate success, are but as episodes to this great epic of self-help. The epic is composed of individual heroisms; it stands to them as the victorious war which subdued an empire stands to the personal act of bravery which spiked<sup>1</sup> a single cannon and was adequately rewarded with a medal. For in emigration the young men enter direct and by the shipload on their heritage of work; empty continents swarm, as at the bo\u2019sun\u2019s whistle,<sup>2</sup> with industrious hands, and whole new empires are domesticated to the service of man.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is the closet picture, and is found, on trial, to consist mostly of embellishments. The more I saw of my fellow-passengers, the less I was tempted to the lyric note. Comparatively few of the men were below thirty; many were married, and encumbered with families; not a few were already up in years; and this itself was out of tune with my imaginations, for the ideal emigrant should certainly be young. Again, I thought he should offer to the eye some bold type of humanity, with bluff or hawk-like features, and the stamp of an eager and pushing disposition. Now those around me were for the most part quiet, orderly, obedient citizens, family men broken by adversity, elderly youths who had failed to place themselves in life, and people who had seen better days. Mildness was the prevailing character; mild mirth and mild endurance. In a word, I was not taking part in an impetuous and conquering sally, such as swept over Mexico or Siberia, but found myself, like Marmion,<sup>3</sup> \u201cin the lost battle, borne down by the flying.\u201d</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Labouring mankind had in the last years, and throughout Great Britain, sustained a prolonged and crushing series of defeats. I had heard vaguely of these reverses; of whole streets of houses standing deserted by the Tyne,<sup>4</sup> the cellar-doors broken and removed for firewood; of homeless men loitering at the street-corners of Glasgow with their chests beside them; of closed factories, useless strikes, and starving girls. But I had never taken them home to me or represented these distresses livingly to my imagination. A turn of the market may be a calamity as disastrous as the French retreat from Moscow;<sup>5</sup> but it hardly lends itself to lively treatment, and makes a trifling figure in the morning papers. We may struggle as we please, we are not born economists. The individual is more affecting than the mass. It is by the scenic accidents, and the appeal to the carnal eye, that for the most part we grasp the significance of tragedies. Thus it was only now, when I found myself involved in the rout, that I began to appreciate how sharp had been the battle. We were a company of the rejected; the drunken, the incompetent, the weak, the prodigal, all who had been unable to prevail against circumstances in the one land, were now fleeting pitifully to another; and though one or two might still succeed, all had already failed. We were a shipful of failures, the broken men of England. Yet it must not be supposed that these people exhibited depression. The scene, on the contrary, was cheerful. Not a tear was shed on board the vessel. All were full of hope for the future, and showed an inclination to innocent gaiety.

Yet they were unable to control events, even in those parts of the world considered to be their respective spheres of influence. The failure of the Soviet Union to have its way in Afghanistan, its decision to withdraw after almost a decade of ugly intervention, was the most striking evidence that even the possession of thermonuclear weapons does not guarantee domination over a determined population. The United States has faced the same reality. It waged a full-scale war in Indochina, conducting the most brutal bombardment of a tiny peninsula in world history, and yet was forced to withdraw. In the headlines every day we see other instances of the failure of the presumably powerful over the presumably powerless, as in Brazil, where a grass-roots movement of workers and the poor elected a new president pledged to fight destructive corporate power.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Looking at this catalogue of huge surprises, it\u2019s clear that the struggle for justice should never be abandoned because of the apparent overwhelming power of those who have the guns and the money and who seem invincible in their determination to hold on to it. That apparent power has, again and again, proved vulnerable to human qualities less measurable than bombs and dollars: moral fervor, determination, unity, organization, sacrifice, wit, ingenuity, courage, patience\u2014whether by blacks in Alabama and South Africa, peasants in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Vietnam, or workers and intellectuals in Poland, Hungary, and the Soviet Union itself. No cold calculation of the balance of power need deter people who are persuaded that their cause is just.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I have tried hard to match my friends in their pessimism about the world (is it just my friends?), but I keep encountering people who, in spite of all the evidence of terrible things happening everywhere, give me hope. Especially young people, in whom the future rests. Wherever I go, I find such people. And beyond the handful of activists there seem to be hundreds, thousands, more who are open to unorthodox ideas. But they tend not to know of one another\u2019s n\u2019t necessarily a blithe, slightly sappy whistler in the dark of our time. To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places\u2014and there are so many\u2014where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don\u2019t have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.</p></div></div></div>",

Taxonomy, the study of classification and hence of biological diversity, has been allowed to dwindle, while other important fields such as space exploration and biomedical studies have flourished. Like glass-blowing and harpsichord manufacture, taxonomy of many kinds of organisms has been left in the hands of a small number of unappreciated specialists who have had few opportunities to train their successors. To take one of hundreds of examples, two of the four most abundant groups of small animals of the soil are springtails and oribatid mites. Marvelously varied, having complex life cycles, and teeming by the millions in every acre of land, these tiny animals play vital ecological roles by consuming dead vegetable matter. Thus they help to drive the energy and materials cycles on which all life depends. Yet there are only four specialists in the United States who can identify springtails\u2014one is retired\u2014and only one is an expert on oribatid mites. The reason that so little is heard about these important organisms in the scientific literature and popular press is that there are so few people who know enough to write about them at any level.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The general neglect of expertise in the face of overwhelming need and opportunity rebounds to the weakness of many other enterprises in science and education. Museums are understaffed, with too few biologists to develop research collections and prepare exhibitions. Systematics, the branch of biology that employs taxonomy and the study of similarities among species to work out the evolution of groups of organisms, is able to address only a minute fraction of life. Biogeography, the analysis of the distribution of organisms, is similarly hobbled. So is ecology, the extremely important discipline that explores the relationships of organisms to their environment and to one another. A great deal of the future of biology depends on the strengthening of taxonomy, for if you can\u2019t tell one kind of plant or animal from another, you are in trouble. Some kinds of research may be held up indefinitely. As the Chinese say, the beginning of wisdom is getting things by their right names.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The study of classification and expertise on \u201cobscure\u201d groups of organisms such as periwinkles, leeches, springtails and mites may receive the needed boost by association with what has come to be known as biodiversity studies. Biodiversity studies constitute a hybrid discipline that took solid form during the 1980s. They can be defined (a bit formally, I admit, but bear with me) as follows: the systematic examination of the full array of organisms and the origin of this diversity, together with the technology by which diversity can be maintained and utilized for the benefit of humanity. Thus biodiversity studies are both scientific in nature, a branch of pure evolutionary biology, and applied studies, a branch of biotechnology.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Two events during the past quarter-century brought biodiversity to center stage and encouraged the deliberately hybrid form of its analysis. The first was the recognition that human activity threatens the extinction of not only a few \u201cstar\u201d species such as giant pandas and California condors, but also a large fraction of all the species of plants and animals on earth. At least one-quarter of the species on earth are likely to vanish due to the cutting and burning of tropical rainforests alone if the current rate of destruction continues. The second reason for the new prominence of biodiversity studies is the recognition that extinction can be slowed and eventually halted without significant cost to humanity. <em>Extinction is not a price we are compelled to pay for economic progress.</em> Quite the contrary: As the examples of the rosy periwinkle and medicinal leech suggest, conservation can promote human welfare. Ultimately conservation might even be necessary for continued progress in many realms of human endeavor.</p></div>",

(4)&nbsp;While few self-portraits of da Vinci exist, Tyler argues that many of da Vinci\u2019s portraits reflect his appearance.

(7) The results confirmed Tyler\u2019s suspicions: da Vinci likely had exotropia, with one eye turning out at -10.3 degrees.</p><p>(8) Tyler\u2019s findings, which he published in <em>JAMA Ophthalmology</em>, created a stir in both the art and science communities. (9) Only about 1&nbsp;percent of the population has exotropia, yet previous studies have suggested that other famous artists\u2014like Rembrandt, Picasso, and Degas\u2014had it as well, which indicates that the eye condition was more common in centuries past than it is now. (10) Tyler believes that da Vinci\u2019s condition was intermittent\u2014that is, his eye drifted out of alignment when he was relaxed, but when he focused, it would realign. (11) If Tyler is right and da Vinci could control his exotropia, then the artist could switch from 2-D to 3-D vision, enhancing his ability to accurately capture three-dimensional figures on a two-dimensional canvas.</p>",

Soon after they started hosing down the kitchen, the commander heard himself shout, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here!\u201d without realizing why. The floor collapsed almost immediately after the firefighters escaped. Only after the fact did the commander realize that the fire had been unusually quiet and that his ears had been unusually hot. Together, these impressions prompted what he called a \u201csixth sense of danger.\u201d He had no idea what was wrong, but he knew something was wrong. It turned out that the heart of the fire had not been in the kitchen but in the basement beneath where the men had stood.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We have all heard such stories of expert intuition: the chess master who walks past a street game and announces \u201cWhite mates in three\u201d without stopping, or the physician who makes a complex diagnosis after a single glance at a patient. Expert intuition strikes us as magical, but it is not. Indeed, each of us performs feats of intuitive expertise many times each day. Most of us are pitch-perfect in detecting anger in the first word of a telephone call, recognize as we enter a room that we were the subject of the conversation, and quickly react to subtle signs that the driver of the car in the next lane is dangerous. Our everyday intuitive abilities are no less marvelous than the striking insights of an experienced firefighter or physician \u2014 only more common.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The psychology of accurate intuition involves no magic. Perhaps the best short statement of it is by the great Herbert Simon, who studied chess masters<sup>2</sup> and showed that after thousands of hours of practice they come to see the pieces on the board differently from the rest of us. You can feel Simon\u2019s impatience with the mythologizing of expert intuition when he writes: \u201cThe situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.\u201d<sup>3</sup></p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We are not surprised when a two-year-old looks at a dog and says \u201cdoggie!\u201d because we are used to the miracle of children learning to recognize and name things. Simon\u2019s point is that the miracles of expert intuition have the same character. Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it. Good intuitive judgments come to mind with the same immediacy as \u201cdoggie!\u201d</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Unfortunately, professionals\u2019 intuitions do not all arise from true expertise. Many years ago I visited the chief investment officer of a large financial firm, who told me that he had just invested some tens of millions of dollars in the stock of Ford Motor Company. When I asked how he had made that decision, he replied that he had recently attended an automobile show and had been impressed. \u201cBoy, do they know how to make a car!\u201d was his explanation. He made it very clear that he trusted his gut feeling and was satisfied with himself and with his decision. I found it remarkable that he had apparently not considered the one question that an economist would call relevant: Is Ford stock currently underpriced? Instead, he had listened to his intuition; he liked the cars, he liked the company, and he liked the idea of owning its stock. From what we know about the accuracy of stock picking, it is reasonable to believe that he did not know what he was doing.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The specific heuristics that Amos [Tversky, the author\u2019s colleague] and I studied provide little help in understanding how the executive came to invest in Ford stock, but a broader conception of heuristics now exists, which offers a good account. An important advance is that emotion now looms much larger in our understanding of intuitive judgments and choices than it did in the past. The executive\u2019s decision would today be described as an example of the affect heuristic,<sup>4</sup> where judgments and decisions are guided directly by feelings of liking and disliking, with little deliberation or reasoning.</p><hr><small><p><span>1 <em>kitchen was on fire</em>: Gary A.

But the married life of the young Brudenells unexpectedly turned out a rustic idyll. They chose to live quietly in the country at the Manor, Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, a Jacobean house set on gently rising ground and framed in chestnut trees. The rector of Hambleden at the time has left letters in which are glimpses of an amiable, charitable and democratic pair. They preferred not to use their title and, even after Robert had succeeded his uncle as Earl of Cardigan, they were known in Hambleden as Mr. and Mrs. Brudenell. They were much given to good works, and Robert, \u201cever a good friend to Hambleden,\u201d bought two and a half acres of land and presented it to the village for cottagers\u2019 gardens; \u201cthese gardens are a great benefit and much prized.\u201d Penelope interested herself in the village women and the school. \u201cShe is a sweet woman, possessing a temper both mild and engaging,\u201d wrote the rector.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And at the Manor on October 16th, 1797, their second child and only male infant was born and christened James Thomas.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The circumstances surrounding his arrival were Impressive. It was three generations since the succession of the Earls of Cardigan had gone direct from father to son. The much desired heir was of almost mystic importance, and, as he lay in his cradle, wealth, rank, power and honours gathered round his head.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was unfortunate that he was destined to grow up in a world that was almost entirely feminine. He already had an elder sister, and seven more girls followed his birth, of whom six survived. He remained the only son, the only boy among seven girls, unique, unchallenged, and the effect on his character was decisive. He was brought up at home among his sisters, and he grew up as such boys do, spoilt, domineering and headstrong. No arm was stronger than his. No rude voice contradicted him, no rough shoulder pushed him. From his earliest consciousness he was the most important, the most interesting, the most influential person in the world. He retained, however, from these early years a liking for the society of women and a softness in his manner toward them which, having regard to his manner with men, struck his contemporaries with surprise. For a woman, a pretty woman, above all a pretty women in distress, James Brudenell, later Lord Cardigan, had an almost medieval deference, a chivalrous turn of phrase, a sometimes embarrassing readiness to protect and defend, which, though productive of astonishment and mirth, were nevertheless rooted in a genuine sympathy.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was to be expected that his parents and sisters should be passionately attached to him, and natural affection and pride were immensely heightened by the circumstance of his extraordinary good looks. In him the Brudenell beauty had come to flower. He was tall, with wide shoulders tapering to a narrow waist, his hair was golden, his eyes flashing sapphire blue, his nose aristocratic, his bearing proud. If there were a fault it was that the lower part of his face was oddly long and narrow so that sometimes one was surprised to catch an obstinate, almost a foxy Look. But the boy had a dash and gallantry that were irresistible. He did not know what fear was. A superb and reckless horseman, he risked his neck on the most dangerous brutes. No tree was too tall for him to climb, no tower too high to scale. He excelled in swordsmanship and promised to be a first-class shot. He had in addition to courage another characteristic which impressed itself on all who met him. He was, alas, unusually stupid; in fact, as Greville pronounced later, an ass. The melancholy truth was that his glorious golden head had nothing in it.</p></div>",

When Ms. Rowling was 15, her mother was diagnosed with degenerative multiple sclerosis; she died, age 45, in December 1990. On a train to London from Manchester earlier that year, Ms. Rowling conceived a series of novels based on a boy wizard. She briefly went to teach English in Portugal, where she contracted a brief marriage, returning penniless with her child to study in Edinburgh. The sickness and death of the author\u2019s mother are pivotal to her creation.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>From the opening page of the first book, the reader engages with Harry\u2019s child\u2019s-eye view of a world ruled by imbeciles and malefactors. Harry Potter is an orphan, alone in a world of mediocrities known as \u201cMuggles,\u201d who do not appreciate his special gifts. Boarding a train to Scotland at platform 9\u00be of Kings Cross Station, London, he finds acceptance as a wizard, magically empowered but under mortal threat from mysterious enemies.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Harry is a Dickensian archetype,<sup>1</sup> a child of cruelty who inspires in us an urge to make a better world. Alongside Oliver Twist, he is the most celebrated orphan in world literature. Oliver is altogether too perfect, untouched by the evil around him. Harry, more credibly, wrestles with forces of darkness and commands our sympathies.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Like Dickens, Ms. Rowling gives some of her secondary characters onomatopoeic names, informing us before we read another word what kind of person they are. Just as Scrooge, Mr. Bumble, Magwitch and Fagin reflect negative traits in Dickens\u2019s world, so do Severus Snape, Quirrell and Filch in that of Harry Potter. Ms. Rowling goes beyond Dickens in imprinting evil into a person\u2019s name. Voldemort means flight of death in French, Malfoy is bad faith.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In common with Dickens, Ms. Rowling knows that the reading public will not be insulted by situations that it can recognize. In Hogwarts, she nods to the classic genre of the English school story, established by \u201cTom Brown\u2019s Schooldays\u201d in 1857. Yet she also draws deep on a well of Nordic mythology, plumbed by J.R.R. Tolkien in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d and by Richard Wagner in his Nibelungen tetralogy.<sup>2</sup> Hagrid, Hedwig and Hogsmeade could readily appear in any of these epics.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The force of the Harry Potter cycle lies, as with Wagner, not so much in the originality of its subject matter as in the execution of a panoptic<sup>3</sup> vision across a great span of time. Dickens, writing week to week, never harbored such grandiose ambition. The closest any other author gets, at this level, to creating and sustaining a fantasy/reality world is Mark Twain in the Tom Sawyer novels, of which four were successfully published during his lifetime.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Tom is supposed to be 11 or 12 years old when the cycle begins, a year or so older than Harry, and Twain employs him as a paradigm of lost American innocence, a nostalgic tweak at his mostly adult readership. Harry represents no other time or place. He is what he is: an English boy who is sent off to boarding school, where, from friends and teachers, he discovers both his own nature as a wizard and the hair-raising hazards that he may face at any time.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is here that Ms. Rowling achieves the double-whammy of getting child readers to emote with a central character who is outwardly like them, inwardly not, empowered by wizardry yet otherwise ordinary. Tom\u2019s magic is pure mischief, fooling another kid to whitewash his aunt\u2019s fence. Harry\u2019s is existential. He pretends at normality, knowing he can shed it at will to frustrate the forces of evil.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Harry, nevertheless, arouses greater empathy because he seems to be a child liberated from the control of dull, distracted adults, rejecting his soulless environment. No sensitive child would want to grow up to be Harry\u2019s Muggle relatives, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of No. 4 Privet Drive. Harry Potter allows children of the suburbs to loathe their Little Boxes,<sup>4</sup> to fly a nebulous broom, play non-televisable sports and aspire to a life out of the ordinary. Whether read in Seattle, Sarajevo or Soweto, Harry gives children a license to judge the adult world\u2014and find it wanting.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>Charles Dickens (1812-1870), author of <em>Oliver Twist</em>, often depicted children facing hardships and cruelty.<br><sup>2</sup>a series of nineteenth-century operas loosely based on Norse sagas<br><sup>3</sup>all-seeing<br><sup>4</sup>the title of a 1962 song describing the sameness of suburban houses</p></small></div></div></div>",

(3) The popular writer Malcolm Gladwell has provided a compelling introduction to the focus group, a research technique in which groups of consumers are asked detailed questions about a new product. (4) As an accurate assessment of the effectiveness of focus groups, however, Gladwell\u2019s story has some shortcomings.</p><p>(5) As journalist Liza Featherstone explains in <em>Divining Desire: Focus Groups and the Culture of Consultation</em>, the social role of focus groups has changed over time in response to political and economic developments. (6)&nbsp;According to one executive interviewed by Featherstone, \u201cYou can\u2019t use focus groups to create an idea . . . a focus group would create an Edsel.\u201d (7) The executive refers to a famously unsuccessful 1957 car model whose shortcomings were blamed on the development team\u2019s excessive use of focus groups. (8)&nbsp;But, as Featherstone shows, focus groups actually rejected some features that spelled the Edsel\u2019s doom, including the name, which group members thought \u201csounded too much like \u2018weasel.\u2019\u201d (9) Other features, such as the unpopular design of the car\u2019s body, were not subject to focus group research at all. (10) Overall, it may be that a truly unfortunate name is what actually contributed to the Edsel\u2019s failure.</p><p>(11) Whether or not focus groups could have saved the Edsel, it is clear that they produced useful feedback. (12)&nbsp;Seen in this light, even the focus groups used by Herman Miller come off better: their reservations about the unusual chair design did correspond to low initial sales figures before the product became a hit. (13) As Eric L. Johnston argues, Gladwell criticizes focus groups for failing to predict the future, something that should not be expected of them. (14) \u201cUltimately, focus groups are just one component in a company\u2019s decision-making process, and they should never be treated as a magical elixir nor a substitute for sound business decisions,\u201d Johnston asserts.</p>",

In describing the virtues and vices of mankind, it is convenient, upon every article, to have some eminent person in our eye, from whom we copy our description. I have strictly observed this rule; and my imagination this minute represents before me a certain great man famous for this talent, to the constant practice of which he owes his twenty years\u2019 reputation of the most skilful head in England, for the management of nice affairs. The superiority of his genius consists in nothing else but an inexhaustible fund of political lies, which he plentifully distributes every minute he speaks, and by an unparalleled generosity forgets, and consequently contradicts the next half hour. He never yet considered whether any proposition were true or false, but whether it were convenient for the present minute or company to affirm or deny it; so that if you think fit to refine upon him by interpreting everything he says, as we do dreams, by the contrary, you are still to seek, and will find yourself equally deceived whether you believe or no: the only remedy is to suppose that you have heard some inarticulate sounds, without any meaning at all. And besides, that will take off the horror you might be apt to conceive at the oaths wherewith he perpetually tags both ends of every proposition: though at the same time I think he cannot with any justice be taxed with perjury, when he invokes God and Christ, because he has often fairly given public notice to the world, that he believes in neither.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Some people may think that such an accomplishment as this, can be of no great use to the owner or his party, after it has been often practised, and is become notorious; but they are widely mistaken: Few lies carry the inventor\u2019s mark, and the most prostitute enemy to truth may spread a thousand without being known for the author. Besides, as the vilest writer has his readers, so the greatest liar has his believers; and it often happens, that if a lie be believed only for an hour, it has done its work, and there is no farther occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it; so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too late, the jest is over, and the tale has had its effect: like a man who has thought of a good repartee when the discourse is changed or the company parted: or, like a physician who has found out an infallible medicine, after the patient is dead.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Considering that natural disposition in many men to lie, and in multitudes to believe, I have been perplexed what to do with that maxim so frequent in everybody\u2019s mouth, that \u201cTruth will at last prevail.\u201d Here has this island* of ours, for the greatest part of twenty years, lain under the influence of such counsels and persons, whose principle and interest it was to corrupt our manners, blind our understanding, drain our wealth, and in time destroy our constitution both in Church and State; and we at last were brought to the very brink of ruin; yet, by the means of perpetual misrepresentations, have never been able to distinguish between our enemies and friends.</p><hr><small><p><span>*England</span></p></small></div>",

As late as the 1950s, the American Cancer Society, which is about as medically conventional as a health-related group could be, still had a \u201cCommittee on Quackery.\u201d<sup>3</sup> But according to <span>Harvard</span> magazine:</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cLater that [committee] turned into a committee on \u2018unproven methods of cancer management,\u2019 superseded by one on \u2018questionable methods.\u2019 The names indicate a gradual acceptance of the unconventional; today the cancer society has a Committee on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). The evolving vocabulary also reflects a sea change underway throughout medicine. In the last few years, the term \u2018alternative,\u2019 suggesting something done <em>instead of</em> conventional medicine, has been giving way to \u2018complementary,\u2019 a therapy done <em>along with</em> mainstream treatment. Both words may ultimately be replaced by \u2018integrative medicine\u2019\u2014the use of techniques like acupuncture, massage, herbal treatments, and meditation in regular medical practice.\u201d</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This may look like commendable humility on the part of conventional medicine\u2014or it may look like a shameless compromise. But how scientific is conventional \u201cscientific\u201d medicine anyway? By the late twentieth century, mathematically oriented physicians, as well as many patients, were beginning to ask for something more than a doctor\u2019s word for the efficacy of medical interventions and something more tangible than the mere aura of science. They wanted hard evidence, and one familiar procedure after another has come up short.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In 1974, a former physician turned mathematician, David M. Eddy, was asked to give a talk on medical decision making, and chose to focus on diagnostic mammography since Betty Ford\u2019s and Happy Rockefeller\u2019s<sup>4</sup> breast cancers were very much in the news at the time. Years later, he wrote that he had \u201cplanned to write out the decision tree I presume their physicians had used, fully expecting to find strong evidence, good numbers, and sound reasoning that I could describe to my audience. But to my amazement I found very few numbers, no formal rationale, and blatant errors in reasoning. How could that be?\u201d</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>He decided to try to study the decision making behind something that had been around much longer than mammography\u2014a seventy-five-year-old treatment for ocular hypertension that had been used on tens of millions of people. But he could find only eight controlled studies\u2014meaning studies comparing people who had received the treatment to a group of similar people who had not\u2014and these studies were all \u201cvery small and poorly designed.\u201d Worse, six of them found that the recipients of treatment ended up worse off than those who had not received it. Eddy moved on to analyze other treatments, only to be warned off by experts who told him there was not enough data to work on.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cThat clinched it. If there wasn\u2019t sufficient information to develop a decision tree, what in the world were physicians basing their decision on? I then realized that medical decision making was not built on a bedrock of evidence or formal analysis, but was standing on Jell-O.\u201d</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So began what was soon called \u201cevidence-based medicine,\u201d the idea that anything performed on patients should be backed up by statistical evidence. This was a provocative designation, raising the immediate question of what medicine had been based on up until now: anecdotes, habits, hunches? Or was medicine traditionally not \u201cevidence-based\u201d but \u201ceminence-based,\u201d that is, backed by the reputations and institutional standing of the people who practiced it?</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Most of the medical screenings that have been pressed on me by one health professional or another fail the evidence-based test. Mammograms, for example: The conventional wisdom, tirelessly repeated by the leading breast cancer advocacy group, the Susan G. Komen Foundation, was that early detection through annual mammography would significantly increase the five-year survival rate from breast cancer. But repeated, huge, often international studies showed no significant decline in breast cancer mortality that could be attributed to routine mammographic screening.</p><hr><small><p><sup>1</sup>improvement in relations<br><sup>2</sup>the American Medical Association<br><sup>3</sup>misinformed or questionable medical practices<br><sup>4</sup>First Lady and Second Lady of the United States from 1974\u20131977</p></small></div></div></div>",

Some talk in synthesized voices; others write a stream of words on a screen. Some manage spaceships; others, the \u201cbrains\u201d of robots, manage their own \u201cbodies.\u201d People converse with them, are understood by them, exchange information and greetings with them. Much of this is still science fiction. But real computers advise lawyers on relevant cases, doctors on diagnoses, engineers on the state of atomic reactors. Both the fantasy and the fact would have astonished our grandparents. <em>Their</em> grandparents might have thought that this could only be achieved by magic. Yet most of us are getting used to it, taking the silicon age for granted.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Still, a suspicion remains. We human beings have always thought of ourselves as special. We all assume some contrast between the world of material things and the world of spiritual things. If the computer really is a \u201cmaterial mind,\u201d then not only must we rethink this distinction, but we have broken it with our own creations. We should be careful to avoid such an important conclusion until we have really thought it through. However natural it seems to take it for granted that computers can think and act, then, we shouldn\u2019t just assume it. In philosophy we often find that what we normally take for granted\u2014the \u201ccommonsense\u201d point of view\u2014gets in the way of a proper understanding of the issues. So let\u2019s see if the way I spoke about computers in the first paragraph is accurate.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I said that they talk. But do they <em>really</em> talk in the sense that people do? It isn\u2019t enough to say that they produce something that sounds like speech. Tape recorders do that, but they don\u2019t talk. When people talk they mean something by what they say. To mean something, they need to be able to understand sentences. Now I also said that computers understand what we say to them. But do they really? The sounds of our speech are turned into electrical impulses. The impulses pass through the circuits of the machine. And that causes the speech synthesizer to produce sounds. It may be very clever to design a machine that does this, but what evidence do we have that the machine understands?</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Well, could a machine understand? There are two obvious responses to this question. The first response I\u2019ll call <strong>mentalist</strong>, for the sake of a label. It\u2019s the response you make if you think that understanding what people say involves having a mind. The mentalist says:</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Computers can\u2019t really understand anything. To understand they would have to have conscious minds. But we made them from silicon chips and we programmed them. We didn\u2019t give them conscious minds. So we know they don\u2019t have them.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>At the other extreme is the response I\u2019ll call <strong>behaviorist</strong>. The behaviorist says:</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Naturally, everyone should agree that some computers don\u2019t understand. But there\u2019s no reason why a computer couldn\u2019t be made that does understand. If a machine responds in the same ways to speech as a person who understands speech, then we have just as much reason to say that the machine understands as we have to say that the person does. A machine that behaves in every way as if it understands is indistinguishable from a machine that understands. If it behaved in the right way, that would show that it had a mind.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is clear why I call this response \u201cbehaviorist.\u201d For the behaviorist says that to understand is to <em>behave </em>as if you understand.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What we have here is a situation that is quite familiar in philosophy. There are two opposing views\u2014mentalist and behaviorist, in this case\u2014each of which seems to have something in its favor, but neither of which looks completely right. Each of these views has a bit of common sense on its side. The mentalist relies on the common sense claim that machines can\u2019t think. The behaviorist relies on the common sense claim that all we know about other people\u2019s minds we know from what they do. It looks as though common sense here isn\u2019t going to tell us if the mentalist or the behaviorist is right.</p></div></div></div>",

        "text": "<p><em>(The passage below is from a book published in the 1980s.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The conquest of Mexico was one aggressive part of the Iberian project to expand its hegemony beyond the known world. One result of this amazing adventure was, surprisingly, a reorientation in world view that, in cartographic terms, saw the growing outline of America replace Jerusalem as the symbolic center of the world.<sup>1</sup> The enchanting places and inhabitants of the Indies were the focus of tremendous curiosity and confusion in Spain. This led to a flurry of published accounts and histories of the explorations, discoveries, and conquests, as well as descriptions of the societies that had been subdued. In this context, there was an effort to produce documents \u201cmore satisfying to the Europeans and make them more readable to one not versed in the native traditions.\u201d<sup>2</sup> This resulted in the limited but enthusiastic encouragement of Indian painters still conversant with the preconquest picture-writing tradition to reproduce picture books that would attract and please European eyes. The best example of this can be seen in the work sponsored by the greatest patron of the native artists, the viceroy of Mexico, Don Antonio de Mendoza, an enthusiastic collector of native \u201ccurios.\u201d Called by one scholar a \u201cRenaissance Maecenas\u201d [Maecenas was a Roman statesman known for his patronage of literature and the arts], Mendoza noted that the ravages of the conquest had destroyed countless native artifacts and had effaced the craft traditions that generated them.<sup>3</sup> He responded in the 1540s by hiring native artists and establishing them in workshops where they could fabricate \u201ccurios\u201d for his own collection and for King Charles I of Spain. One of the most beautiful and revealing pictorial documents composed under his patronage was the <em>Codex Mendoza</em>, which consisted of seventy-one folios bound at the spine in the manner of European books, but painted largely in the native style. Picture pages alternate with Spanish translations of the pictographs and ideographs. Although the pre-Columbian mode of pictorial representation had been altered somewhat in this document, authentic Aztec patterns of symbolic thought, tribute collection, and daily life were presented, making this codex extremely valuable for interpreting Mesoamerican urbanism. In this manner, the ancient tradition was revived and Spanish understanding of Aztec life increased.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In New Spain the task of building a new system forced both the colonizers and the colonized to utilize the indigenous maps, tribute records, land claims, and genealogies in order for Spanish political and administrative order to be imposed and maintained in such a rapidly changing society. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the new colonial communities, a research effort was ordered by Philip II of Spain. He had a series of questionnaires sent to the colony, compelling the local administrators of each town and region to compile organized descriptions of native society. A large number of <em>Relaciones Geogr\u00e1ficas and Descripciones</em> were compiled, each requiring a map or <em>pintura</em> of the local community\u2019s geography.<sup>4</sup> These maps carried vestiges of the native pictorial tradition and served to reanimate the art in local situations.

        "text": "<p><em>(The following passage is from an essay by a nineteenth-century British writer.)</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>With Imagination in the popular sense, command of imagery and metaphorical expression, Bentham<sup>*</sup> was, to a certain degree, endowed. For want, indeed, of poetical culture, the images with which his fancy supplied him were seldom beautiful, but they were quaint and humorous, or bold, forcible, and intense: passages might be quoted from him both of playful irony, and of declamatory eloquence, seldom surpassed in the writings of philosophers. The Imagination which he had not, was that to which the name is generally appropriated by the best writers of the present day; that which enables us, by a voluntary effort, to conceive the absent as if it were present, the imaginary as if it were real, and to clothe it in the feelings which, if it were indeed real, it would bring along with it. This is the power by which one human being enters into the mind and circumstances of another. This power constitutes the poet, in so far as he does anything but melodiously utter his own actual feelings. It constitutes the dramatist entirely. It is one of the constituents of the historian; by it we understand other times; by it Guizot interprets to us the middle ages; Nisard, in his beautiful Studies on the later Latin poets, places us in the Rome of the Caesars; Michelet disengages the distinctive characters of the different races and generations of mankind from the facts of their history. Without it nobody knows even his own nature, further than circumstances have actually tried it and called it out; nor the nature of his fellow-creatures, beyond such generalizations as he may have been enabled to make from his observation of their outward conduct.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>By these limits, accordingly, Bentham's knowledge of human nature is bounded. It is wholly empirical; and the empiricism of one who has had little experience. He had neither internal experience nor external; the quiet, even tenor of his life, and his healthiness of mind, conspired to exclude him from both. He never knew prosperity and adversity, passion nor satiety: he never had even the experiences which sickness gives: he lived from childhood to the age of eighty-five in boyish health. He knew no dejection, no heaviness of heart. He never felt life a sore and weary burden. He was a boy to the last. Self-consciousness, that daemon of the men of genius of our time, from Wordsworth to Byron, from Goethe to Chateaubriand, and to which this age owes so much both of its cheerful and its mournful wisdom, never was awakened in him. How much of human nature slumbered in him he knew not, neither can we know. He had never been made alive to the unseen influences which were acting on himself, nor consequently on his fellow-creatures. Other ages and other nations were a blank to him for purposes of instruction. He measured them but by one standard; their knowledge of facts, and their capability to take correct views of utility, and merge all other objects in it. His own lot was cast in a generation of the leanest and barrenest men whom England had yet produced, and he was an old man when a better race came in with the present century. He saw accordingly in man little but what the vulgarest eye can see; recognized no diversities of character but such as he who runs may read. Knowing so little of human feelings, he knew still less of the influences by which those feelings are formed; all the more subtle workings both of the mind upon itself, and of external things upon the mind, escaped him; and no one, probably, who, in a highly instructed age, ever attempted to give a rule to all human conduct, set out with a more limited conception either of the agencies by which human conduct <em>is</em>, or of those by which it <em>should</em> be, influenced.</p><hr><small><p><span><sup>*</sup>Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was an English philosopher and the founder of Utilitarianism, the theory that the aim of action should be greatest happiness of the greatest number.</span></p></small>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A few years ago, Gene Robinson, of Urbana, Illinois, asked some associates in southern Mexico to help him kidnap some 1,000 newborns. For their victims they chose bees. Half were European honeybees, <em>Apis mellifera ligustica</em>, the sweet-tempered kind most beekeepers raise. The other half were <em>ligustica</em>\u2019s genetically close cousins, <em>Apis mellifera scutellata</em>, the African strain better known as killer bees. Though the two subspecies are nearly indistinguishable, the latter defend territory far more aggressively. Kick a European honeybee hive and perhaps a hundred bees will attack you. Kick a killer bee hive and you may suffer a thousand stings or more. Two thousand will kill you.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Working carefully, Robinson\u2019s conspirators\u2014researchers at Mexico\u2019s National Center for Research in Animal Physiology, in the high resort town of Ixtapan de la Sal\u2014jiggled loose the lids from two African hives and two European hives, pulled free a few honeycomb racks, plucked off about 250 of the youngest bees from each hive, and painted marks on the bees\u2019 tiny backs. Then they switched each set of newborns into the hive of the other subspecies.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Robinson [...] did not fret about the bees\u2019 safety. He knew that if you move bees to a new colony in their first day, the colony accepts them as its own. Nevertheless, Robinson did expect the bees would be changed by their adoptive homes: He expected the killer bees to take on the European bees\u2019 moderate ways and the European bees to assume the killer bees\u2019 more violent temperament. Robinson had discovered this in prior experiments. But he hadn\u2019t yet figured out how it happened.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>[...]Robinson, however, suspected that environment could spin the dials on \u201cbig sectors of genes, right across the genome\u201d\u2014and that an individual\u2019s social environment might exert a particularly powerful effect. Who you hung out with and how they behaved, in short, could dramatically affect which of your genes spoke up and which stayed quiet\u2014and thus change who you were.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>[...]To a bee, the pheromone makes a social statement: <em>Friends, you are in danger</em>. Robinson had long known that bees react to this cry by undergoing behavioral and neural changes: Their brains fire up and they literally fly into action. He also knew that repeated alarms make African bees more and more hostile. When Alaux looked at the gene-expression profiles of the bees exposed again and again to alarm pheromone, he and Robinson saw why: With repeated alarms, hundreds of genes\u2014genes that previous studies had associated with aggression\u2014grew progressively busier. The rise in gene expression neatly matched the rise in the aggressiveness of the bees\u2019 response to threats.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Robinson had not expected that. \u201cThe pheromone just lit up the gene expression, and it kept leaving it higher.\u201d The reason soon became apparent: Some of the genes affected were transcription factors\u2014genes that regulate other genes. This created a cascading gene-expression response, with scores of genes responding.</p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>[...] Robinson\u2019s staff removed the bees\u2019 sesame-seed-size brains, ground them up, and ran them through a DNA microarray machine. This identified which genes were busy in a bee\u2019s brain at the moment it met the bee-vac. When Robinson sorted his data by group\u2014European bees raised in African hives, for instance, or African bees raised normally among their African kin\u2014he could see how each group\u2019s genes reacted to their lives.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Robinson organized the data for each group onto a grid of red and green color-coded squares: Each square represented a different gene, and its color represented the group\u2019s average rate of gene expression. Red squares represented genes that were especially active in most of the bees in that group; the brighter the red, the more bees in which that gene had been busy. Green squares represented genes that were silent or underactive in most of the group. </p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When he got the cards, says Robinson, \u201cthe results were stunning.\u201d For the bees that had been kidnapped, life in a new home had indeed altered the activity of \u201cwhole sectors\u201d of genes. When their gene expression data was viewed on the cards alongside the data for groups of bees raised among their own kin, a mere glance showed the dramatic change. Hundreds of genes had flipped colors. The move between hives didn\u2019t just make the bees act differently. It made their genes work differently, and on a broad scale.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What\u2019s more, the cards for the adopted bees of both species came to ever more resemble, as they moved through life, the cards of the bees they moved in with. With every passing day their genes acted more like those of their new hive mates (and less like those of their genetic siblings back home). Many of the genes that switched on or off are known to affect behavior; several are associated with aggression. The bees also acted differently. Their dispositions changed to match that of their hive mates. It seemed the genome, without changing its code, could transform an animal into something very like a different subspecies.</p><p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>These bees didn\u2019t just act like different bees. They\u2019d pretty much become different bees. To Robinson, this spoke of a genome far more fluid\u2014far more socially fluid\u2014than previously conceived. [...]</p>",

He was a gay and impudent and satirical and delightful young black man \u2013 a slave \u2013 who daily preached sermons from the top of his master\u2019s woodpile, with me for the sole audience. He imitated the pulpit style of the several clergymen of the village, and did it well, and with fine passion and energy. To me he was a wonder. I believed he was the greatest orator in the United States and would some day be heard from. But it did not happen; in the distribution of rewards he was overlooked. It is the way, in this world.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I listened to the sermons from the open window of a lumber room at the back of the house. One of his texts was this:  \u201cYou tell me whar a man gets his corn pone, en I\u2019ll tell you what his \u2018pinions is.\u201d</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I can never forget it. It was deeply impressed upon me. By my mother. Not upon my memory, but elsewhere. She had slipped in upon me while I was absorbed and not watching. The black philosopher\u2019s idea was that a man is not independent, and cannot afford views which might interfere with his bread and butter. If he would prosper, he must train with the majority; in matters of large moment, like politics and religion, he must think and feel with the bulk of his neighbors, or suffer damage in his social standing and in his business prosperities. He must restrict himself to corn-pone opinions \u2013 at least on the surface. He must get his opinions from other people; he must reason out none for himself; he must have no first hand views.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I think Jerry was right, in the main, but I think he did not go far enough.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>1. It was his idea that a man conforms to the majority view of his locality by not the calculation and intention.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This happens, but I think it is not the rule. </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>2. It was his idea that there is such a thing as a first-hand opinion; an original opinion; an opinion which is coldly reasoned out in a man\u2019s head, by a searching analysis of the facts involved, with the heart unconsulted, and the jury room closed against outside influences.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It may be that such an opinion has been born somewhere, at some time or other, but I suppose it got away before they could catch it and stuff it and put it in a museum.</p><p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I am persuaded that a coldly-thought-out and independent verdict upon a fashion in clothes, or manners, or literature, or politics, or religion, or any other matter that is projected into the field of our notice and interest, is a most rare thing \u2013 if it indeed ever existed. A new thing in costume appears \u2013 the flaring hoopskirt, for example \u2013 and the passers-by are shocked, and the irreverent laugh. Six months later everybody is reconciled; the fashion has established itself; it is admired, now, and no one laughs. Public opinion resented it before, public opinion accepts it now, and is happy in it. Why? Was the resentment reasoned out? Was the acceptance reasoned out? No. The instinct that moves to conformity did the work.  It is our nature to conform; it is a force which not many can successfully resist.  What is its seat? The inborn requirement of self-approval.  We all have to bow to that; there are no exceptions. Even the woman who refuses from first to last to wear the hoopskirt comes under that law and is its slave; she could not wear the skirt and have her own approval; and that she must have, she cannot help herself. But as a rule our self-approval has its source in but one place and not elsewhere \u2013 the approval of other people.</p><p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Broadly speaking, there are none but corn-pone opinions. And broadly speaking, corn-pone stands for self-approval. Self-approval is acquired mainly from the approval of other people.  The result is conformity. Sometimes conformity has a sordid business interest \u2013 the bread-and-butter interest \u2013but not in most cases, I think.  I think that in the majority of cases it is unconscious and not calculated; that it is born of the human being\u2019s natural yearning to stand well with his fellows and have their inspiring approval and praise \u2013 a yearning which is commonly so strong and so insistent that it cannot be effectually resisted, and must have its way.</p>",

Were mankind totally free from every tincture of prejudice in favour of those gallant exertions which could not exist were there not the evil of violence to combat; had they never seen in their own days, or been told by father or grandfathers, of battles, and were there no traces of the art of war, I have no doubt that they would treat as fabulous or allegorical, the accounts in history, of prodigious armies being formed, of men who engaged themselves for an unlimited time, under the penalty of immediate death, to obey implicitly the orders of commanders to whom they were not attached either by affection or by interest; that these armies were sometimes led with toilsome expedition over vast tracts of land, sometimes crouded into ships, and obliged to endure tedious, unhealthy, and perilous voyages; and that the purpose of all this toil and danger was not to obtain any comfort or pleasure, but to be in a situation to encounter other armies; and that those opposite multitudes the individuals of which had no cause to quarrel, no ill-will to each other, continued for hours engaged with patient and obstinate perseverance, while thousands were slain, and thousands crushed and mangled by the diversity of wounds. </p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>How long war will continue to be practised, we have no means of conjecturing. Civilization, which it might have been expected would have abolished it, has only refined its savage rudeness. The irrationality remains, though we have learnt insanire certa ratione modoque, to have a method in our madness. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That amiable religion which 'proclaims peace on earth,' hath not as yet made war to cease. The furious passions of men, modified as they are by moral instruction, still operate with much force; and by a perpetual fallacy, even the conscientious in each contending nation think they may join in war, because they each believe they are repelling an aggressor. Were the mild and humane doctrine of those Christians, who are called Quakers, which Mr Jenyns has lately embellished with his elegant pen, to prevail, human felicity would gain more than we can well conceive. But perhaps it is necessary that mankind in this state of existence, the purpose of which is so mysterious, should ever suffer the woes of war.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>To relieve my readers from reflections which they may think too abstract, I shall conclude this paper with a few observations upon actual war. In ancient times when a battle was fought man to man, or as somebody has very well expressed it, was a group of duels, there was an opportunity for individuals to distinguish themselves by vigour and bravery. One who was a 'robustus acri militia, hardy from keen warfare,' could gratify his ambition for fame, by the exercise of his own personal qualities. It was therefore more reasonable then, for individuals to enlist, than it is in modern times; for, a battle now is truly nothing else than a huge conflict of opposite engines worked by men, who are themselves as machines directed by a few; and the event is not so frequently decided by what is actually done, as by accidents happening in the dreadful confusion. It is as if two towns in opposite territories should be set on fire at the same time, and victory should be declared to the inhabitants of that in which the flames were least destructive. We hear much of the conduct of generals; and Addison himself has represented the Duke of Marlborough directing an army in battle, as an 'angel riding in a whirlwind and directing the storm.' Nevertheless I much doubt if upon many occasions the immediate schemes of a commander have had certain effect; and I believe Sir Callaghan O'Bralachan in Mr Macklin's Love A la-mode gives a very just account of modern battle: 'There is so much doing every where that we cannot tell what is doing any where.'</p>",

(3)&nbsp;But perhaps the most important factor in convincing authors that they needed new ways of writing was the First World War.</p><p>(4) Some writers, such as the poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, had firsthand experiences as soldiers that led them to depart from shopworn stuff that made warfare seem all right and depict the ugly realities of war.

        "text": "<p><em>9/11 Address, George Bush</em></p><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Good evening. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes or in their offices \u2014 secretaries, business men and women, military and federal workers. Moms and dads. Friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge \u2014 huge structures collapsing, have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong. A great people has been moved to defend a great nation.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest  buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack because we're the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining. </p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today, our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature, and we responded with the best of America. With the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in any way they could. Immediately following the first attack, I implemented our government's emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it's prepared. Our emergency teams are  working in New York City and Washington D.C. to help with local rescue efforts. Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks. The functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will be open for business as well.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The search is underway for those who were behind these evil acts. I have directed the full resources of our  intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no  distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.  I appreciate so very much the members of Congress who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their condolences and assistance. America and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace and security in the world, and we stand together to win the war against terrorism.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Tonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, for the children whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense of safety and security has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by a Power greater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23: \u201cEven though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for you are with me.\u201d</p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day, yet we go forward to defend  freedom and all that is good and just in our world.</p> <p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Thank you. Good night and God bless America.</p>",

(2) In 1982, paleontologists studying the fossil record noticed something curious: the major extinction events\u2014such as that of the dinosaurs approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago\u2014seemed to have occurred regularly every 26&nbsp;million years. (3)&nbsp;Could astronomical events, such as the asteroid strike believed to have caused the dinosaurs\u2019 extinction, be responsible for all of these events?</p><p>(4) To answer this question, in 1984 physicist Richard Muller proposed the existence of a twin star in our solar system, a red dwarf companion to the Sun approximately 1.5&nbsp;light-years away. (5)&nbsp;Every 26 million years, when this \u201cNemesis\u201d star passed through the Oort cloud, a theoretical sphere of icy debris at the outer edge of the solar system, it would create disturbances that would send icy bodies on a catastrophic collision course with Earth.</p><p>(6) Small and dim, such a star could not have been seen with the technology available at the time, but subsequent research, such as the discovery of other systems where debris disks like the Oort cloud appeared to have been affected by a companion star, seemed to support the Nemesis theory. (7)&nbsp;And in 2003, when astronomers discovered a dwarf planet in the outer reaches of the solar system, far from the Sun, they were surprised.</p><p>(8) However, as technology has become more sophisticated, the Nemesis theory seems increasingly unlikely. (9)&nbsp;For one thing, recent fossil studies have shown that extinction events also occur at times other than every 26&nbsp;million years; in fact, some scientists believe that they occur randomly\u2014that is, with no discernible pattern or predictability. (10) And while the Sun may well have had a twin at some point (a 2017 study of the Perseus molecular cloud suggests that most stars like the Sun were formed with companions), most experts now agree that if Nemesis ever existed, it broke free of the solar system early in the Sun\u2019s history, long before there was life on Earth, and thus could not have figured in any extinctions. (11)\u00b7Neither of two large-scale studies using highly sensitive instruments\u20142MASS and NASA\u2019s WISE\u2014have detected anything that could be Nemesis.</p>",

        "text": "<p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Last Sunday the host of a popular news show asked me what it meant to lose my body. The host was broadcasting from Washington, D.C., and I was seated in a remote studio on the Far West Side of Manhattan. A satellite closed the miles between us, but no machinery could close the gap between her world and the world for which I had been summoned to speak. When the host asked me about my body, her face faded from the screen, and was replaced by a scroll of words, written by me earlier that week.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The host read these words for the audience, and when she finished she turned to the subject of my body, although she did not mention it specifically. But by now I  am accustomed to intelligent people asking about the condition of my body without realizing the nature of their request. Specifically, the host wished to know why I felt that white America\u2019s progress, or rather the progress of those Americans who believe that they are white, was built on looting and violence. Hearing this, I felt an old and indistinct sadness well up in me. The answer to this question is the record of the believers themselves. The answer is American history.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There is nothing extreme in this statement. Americans deify democracy in a way that allows for a dim awareness that they have, from time to time, stood in defiance of their God. This defiance is not to be much dwelled upon. Democracy is a forgiving God and America\u2019s heresies\u2014torture, theft, enslavement\u2014are specimens of sin, so common among individuals and nations that none can declare themselves immune. In fact, Americans, in a real sense, have never betrayed their God. When Abraham Lincoln declared, in 1863, that the battle of Gettysburg must ensure \u201cthat government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth,\u201d he was not merely being aspirational. At the onset of the Civil War, the United States of America had one of the highest rates of suffrage in the world. The question is not whether Lincoln truly meant \u201cgovernment of the people\u201d but what our country has, throughout its history, taken the political term <em>people</em> to actually mean. In 1863 it did not mean your mother or your grandmother, and it did not mean you and me. As for now, it must be said that the elevation of the belief in being white was not achieved through wine tastings and ice-cream socials, but rather through the pillaging of life, liberty, labor, and land.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That Sunday, on that news show, I tried to explain this as best I could within the time allotted. But at the end of the segment, the host flashed a widely shared picture of a 12-year-old black boy tearfully hugging a white police officer. Then she asked me about \u201chope.\u201d And I knew then that I had failed. And I remembered that I had expected to fail. And I wondered again at the indistinct sadness welling up in me. Why exactly was I sad? I came out of the studio and walked for a while. It was a calm late-November day. Families, believing themselves white, were out on the streets. Infants, raised to be white, were bundled in strollers. And I was sad for these people, much as I was sad for the host and sad for all the people out there watching and reveling in a specious hope. I realized then why I was sad. When the journalist asked me about my body, it was like she was asking me to awaken her from the most gorgeous dream. I have seen that dream all my life. It is perfect houses with nice lawns. It is Memorial Day cookouts, block associations, and driveways. The Dream is tree houses and the Cub Scouts. And for so long I have wanted to escape into the Dream, to fold my country over my head like a blanket. But this has never been an option, because the Dream rests on our backs, the bedding made from our bodies. And knowing this, knowing that the Dream persists by warring with the known world, I was sad for the host, I was sad for all those families, I was sad for my country, but above all, in that moment, I was sad for you.

(4) Considering that the penny has virtually no purchasing power, it does nothing except add unnecessary weight to our pockets and purses. (5)&nbsp;The United States should follow the lead of other countries and discontinue the penny, because it is obsolete and costs more than it is worth.</p><p>(6) The penny has become useless as a means of exchange. (7) As economist Greg Mankiw says, \u201cWhen people start leaving a monetary unit at the cash register for the next customer, the unit is too small to be useful.\u201d (8)&nbsp;Pennies once had notable value, but decades of increasing prices sapped their individual buying power, and today you can\u2019t even use them in vending machines or parking meters. (9) It\u2019s no wonder that pennies get tossed in fountains, forgotten under sofa cushions, or abandoned on the sidewalk.</p><p>(10) In 2001, it cost 0.79 cents to make a penny, but now, with metal costs increasing, the cost has changed in a noteworthy way. (11) Thus, the United States Mint loses money for every penny it produces; in 2014, for instance, it lost $55 million producing pennies. (12) They also waste retailers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 time. (13) A recent study showed that counting pennies at the register adds an average of two seconds to every cash transaction. (14)&nbsp;This adds up to about 2.4 hours a year for the average American.</p><p>(15) Penny defenders fear that rounding prices to the nearest nickel will result in higher prices for consumers. (16) However, other countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, have successfully retired the penny without a significant increase in prices. (17) Moreover, the United States retired the half cent in 1857 when it lost its value and saw no ill effects in the economy.</p><p>(18) Despite the compelling reasons to get rid of the penny, nearly half of Americans oppose the idea.

Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, \u2014 \"That government is best which governs not at all\"; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This American government \u2014 what is it but a tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must have some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy that idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow. Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. It does not keep the country free. It does not settle the West. It does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone by it. Trade and commerce, if they were not made of India rubber, would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of their actions, and not partly by their intentions, they would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it.</p>",

Kennedy visited Berlin, speaking to the people of this city and the world at the City Hall. Well, since then two other presidents have come, each in his turn, to Berlin. And today I, myself, make my second visit to your city.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>...We come to Berlin, we American presidents, because it's our duty to speak, in this place, of freedom. But I must confess, we're drawn here by other things as well: by the feeling of history in this city, more than 500 years older than our own nation; by the beauty of the Grunewald and the Tiergarten; most of all, by your courage and determination. Perhaps the composer Paul Lincke understood something about American presidents. You see, like so many presidents before me, I come here today because wherever I go, whatever I do: <em>Ich hab noch einen Koffer in Berlin.</em> [I still have a suitcase in Berlin.] ...I join you, as I join your fellow countrymen in the West, in this firm, this unalterable belief: <em>Es gibt nur ein Berlin.</em> [There is only one Berlin.]</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of Europe. From the Baltic, south, those barriers cut across Germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs, and guard towers. ...It is here in Berlin where the wall emerges most clearly; here, cutting across your city, where the news photo and the television screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the world. Standing before the Brandenburg Gate, every man is a German, separated from his fellow men. Every man is a Berliner, forced to look upon a scar.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>...As long as the gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind. Yet I do not come here to lament. For I find in Berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this wall, a message of triumph.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In this season of spring in 1945, the people of Berlin emerged from their air-raid shelters to find devastation. Thousands of miles away, the people of the United States reached out to help. And in 1947 Secretary of State--as you've been told--George Marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the Marshall Plan. Speaking precisely 40 years ago this month, he said: \"Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>...Japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant. Italy, France, Belgium--virtually every nation in Western Europe saw political and economic rebirth; the European Community was founded. In West Germany and here in Berlin, there took place an economic miracle, the <em>Wirtschaftswunder.</em> ...Where four decades ago there was rubble, today in West Berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city in Germany \u2014 busy office blocks, fine homes and apartments, proud avenues, and the spreading lawns of parkland. Where a city's culture seemed to have been destroyed, today there are two great universities, orchestras and an opera, countless theaters, and museums. Where there was want, today there's abundance \u2014 food, clothing, automobiles \u2014  the wonderful goods of the Ku'damm. </p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>...The Soviets may have had other plans. But my friends, there were a few things the Soviets didn't count on \u2014 <em>Berliner Herz, Berliner Humor, ja, und Berliner Schnauze.</em> [Berliner heart, Berliner humor, yes, and a Berliner Schnauze.] ...And now the Soviets themselves may, in a limited way, be coming to understand the importance of freedom. We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness. Some political  prisoners have been released. Certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed. Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control.</p> <p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state? Or are they token gestures, intended to raise false hopes in the West, or to strengthen the Soviet system without changing it?  ...There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace. General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!...</p>",

The homes were scrubbed and scoured, \u2014 above all, one; the gardens and yards had an unwonted trimness, and Jennie bought a new gingham. With some finesse and negotiation, all the dark Methodists and Presbyterians were induced to join in a monster welcome at the Baptist Church; and as the day drew near, warm discussions arose on every corner as to the exact extent and nature of John\u2019s accomplishments.  </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was noontide on a gray and cloudy day when he came. The black town flocked to the depot, with a little of the white at the edges, \u2014 a happy throng, with \u201cGood-mawnings\u201d and \u201cHowdys\u201d and laughing and joking and jostling. Mother sat in the window watching; but sister Jennie stood on the platform, nervously fingering her dress, \u2014 tall and lithe, with soft brown skin and loving eyes peering from out a tangled wilderness of hair. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>John rose gloomily as the train stopped, for he was thinking of the \u201cJim Crow\u201d car; he stepped to the platform, and paused: a little dingy station, a black crowd gaudy and dirty, a half-mile of dilapidated shanties along a straggling ditch of mud. An overwhelming sense of the sordidness and narrowness of it all seized him; he looked in vain for his mother, kissed coldly the tall, strange girl who called him brother, spoke a short, dry word here and there; then, lingering neither for hand-shaking nor gossip, raising his hat merely to the last eager old aunty, to her open-mouthed astonishment.  </p> <p>[...] </p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The meeting of welcome at the Baptist Church was a failure. Rain spoiled the barbecues, and thunder turned the milk in the ice-cream. When the speaking came at night, the house was crowded to overflowing. The three preachers had especially prepared themselves, but somehow John\u2019s manner seemed to throw a blanket over everything, \u2014 he seemed so cold and preoccupied, and had so strange an air of restraint [...] </p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The people moved uneasily in their seats as John rose to reply. He spoke slowly and methodically.  The age, he said, demanded new ideas; we were far different from those men of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, \u2014 with broader ideas of human brotherhood and destiny. Then he spoke of the rise of charity and popular education, and particularly of the spread of wealth and work. The question was, then, he added reflectively, looking at the low discolored ceiling, what part the Negroes of this land would take in the striving of the new century. He sketched in vague outline the new Industrial School that might rise among these pines, he spoke in detail of the charitable and philanthropic work that might be organized, of money that might be saved for banks and businesses. Finally he urged unity, and deprecated especially religious and denominational bickering.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\u201cTo-day,\u201d he said, with a smile, \u201cthe world cares little whether a man be Baptist or Methodist, or indeed a churchman at all, so long as he is good and true. What difference does it make whether a man be baptized in river or wash-bowl, or not at all? Let\u2019s leave all that littleness, and look higher.\u201d  Then, thinking of nothing else, he slowly sat down. </p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A painful hush seized that crowded mass. Little had they understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue, save the last word about baptism; that they knew, and they sat very still while the clock ticked.</p> <p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>He arose silently, and passed out into the night. Down toward the sea he went, in the fitful starlight, half-conscious of the girl who followed timidly after him.

(2)You may not think about it as you sip your caramel macchiato, but a lot of chemistry went into the making of your drink, and it\u2019s serious science. (3)For instance, true coffee experts understand that it\u2019s the different chemical compounds that make up the aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, and body of a cup of joe and they use science to achieve a certain outcome.</p><p>(4)One key component (out of a large, continuously growing number of components) as to how the final product in your cup will taste has to do with how the coffee bean is processed. (5)The three most commonly used methods are: washed, natural, and honey. (6)Though all methods start with the farmer\u2019s role of growing the coffee cherries (the beans are the seeds) and the fruit absorbing the right amount of natural sugars and nutrients during the growing cycle, washed coffees rely on these factors a degree more than the other methods. (7)In the washed processing method, the beans are harvested, and the different fruit layers are removed by water before the bean is left to dry and then milled. (8)Natural processed coffee is considered the most eco-friendly as it leaves the fruit on the bean to dry naturally so little tampering with the fruit occurs beforehand, but the dryness of the bean isn\u2019t as consistent as with the washed method, causing some to surmise that this process produces a lesser quality coffee. (9)Honey processed coffee (which has nothing to do with honey but gets its name from the honey-like stickiness of the bean before it\u2019s dry) utilizes techniques from both the washed and natural methods of processing. (10)The beans are harvested when they are very ripe and the outer fruit layer is taken off, but the inner mucilage (packed with sucrose and acids) is left on to dry naturally before the bean is milled and roasted.</p><p>(11)As the popularity of coffee science education continues to grow, perhaps someday you\u2019ll find yourself interested in joining the many international participants as they attend classes in Italy and other locations with the goal of earning their coffee science certificate.</p>",

        "type": "Essay",
        "text": "<span><em>Euphemise This, John McWhorter</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>[...] Opinion can permeate a euphemism to such an extent that it becomes difficult to conceive of how it once sounded. <em>Welfare</em> was a replacement for what was once commonly referred to as <em>home relief</em>. The empathy in that term was soon blunted by associations with the people granted relief, such that older generations will recall <em>home relief</em> practically uttered as a negative epithet by the 1950s and \u201960s. Meanwhile, reflect on what a warm, charitable word <em>welfare</em> is at its core, and how much static and bile we must peel away to hear it that way again. Similar is <em>affirmative action</em>: a term that 50 years ago resounded with a clean, stalwart clang of high-minded social justice now sounds freighted, sour, vague and tired to many on both sides of the political spectrum. <em>Racial preferences</em> was an attempt at a replacement \u2013 and note its similar fate.</p>[...] <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This sheds light on the linguist George Lakoff\u2019s briefly acclaimed proposal during the George W Bush administration that Democrats could regain influence bychanging the terms for things reviled by Republicans. Taxes could be <em>membership</em> <em>fees</em>; trial lawyers could be <em>public protection attorneys</em>. As fresh as this idea seemed, it could have only worked temporarily, as the history of words such as <em>welfare</em> demonstrates. The nature of language and humanity is such that, after about 20 years, those criticising taxation rates would have come to process and discuss \u2018membership fees\u2019 with the same contempt with which they once discussed \u2018taxes\u2019, just as it has got to the point that <em>custodian</em> now has roughly the same feel as <em>janitor</em>, for which it emerged as a euphemism in the 1940s. <em>Custodian</em> makes one think not of \u2018custody\u2019 but of a mop.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Thought will always catch up with the word. Make no mistake, the thoughts can be ones that many would consider welcome. A hundred years ago, in industry, <em>efficiency</em> was associated with the \u2018scientific management\u2019 theories of Frederick Taylor, the US mechanical engineer and one of the first management consultants, in search of the maximum output from factory labourers. However, as this kind of efficiency often led to the need for fewer workers, a question arose as to whom the efficiency was intended most to benefit.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today, <em>efficiency</em> carries a faintly minatory air, in contrast to its first neutral, and then glamorous, feel as the 20th century got underway. <em>Downsizing</em>, an attempt to euphemise the dismissal of workers for the purposes of the bottom line, rapidly lost any impartial connotation it was crafted to purvey. In the mid-20th century, <em>urban renewal</em> was a term of art for what on the ground displaced millions of Americans, often from low-income but stable neighbourhoods deemed \u2018slums\u2019 and razed down. Today, that reality has been aired amply and publicly, such that <em>urban renewal</em> calls to mind a bulldozer mowing down innocent people\u2019s homes. Notably, there seems to be no replacement term for <em>urban renewal</em>, partly because the policies of urban czars such as New York\u2019s city planner Robert Moses have been so thoroughly repudiated that public officials no longer espouse any similar doctrine. Ultimately, words alone cannot do this: <em>urban renewal</em> itself began as a euphemism for the more direct <em>slum clearance</em>, but the practice only burgeoned for decades thereafter. It took thought changing to truly transform.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The euphemism treadmill, then, is neither just a form of bureaucratese, nor of identity politics. It is a symptom of the fact that, however much we would like it to be otherwise, it\u2019s easier to change language than to change thought. Moreover, the euphemism treadmill is neither new nor does it churn faster than it once did. When you ask someone <em>Where\u2019s the men\u2019s?</em>, you are using a replacement for the <em>restroom</em> that can summon a vision of a certain undersanitised room in the back of a Wendy\u2019s fast-food restaurant. Yet the very idea of it being a \u2018rest\u2019 room began as an exquisite attempt to wave away miasmic associations after <em>bathroom</em> ceased to do the job any better than had <em>toilet</em> or <em>lavatory</em>, deflecting attention to grooming and cleansing over what else happens in the room. Historically, <em>lavatory</em> is first attested in 1864, <em>restroom</em> followed hot on its heels a few decades later, at the turn of the 20th century, and then <em>men\u2019s room</em> came into fashion in the 1920s.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This means that, in a linguistically mature society, we should expect that the terms we introduce to help us kick off new ways of thinking will require periodic replacement, like tyres. In our moment, <em>special-needs student</em> would appear about due for a swap-out. Meanwhile, the term <em>innovation</em> has been fashionable for just long enough among corporate and political types that it has taken on their hucksterish associations. <em>Invention</em>, for their purposes, would be better, although by about 2035 we can assume that this word too will sound, from the mouths of that era\u2019s managers and mayors, equally fulsome.</p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Reality persists. It\u2019s language we have control over \u2013 at least, for a while.</p>",

(3) Many media accounts claimed that the newly discovered mechanism shows how the Egyptians were able to move the giant stone blocks used to construct the pyramids. (4) Therefore, while the finding offers insight into ancient technological achievements, it actually only adds to the mystery of how Egypt\u2019s iconic monuments were built. (5) The pyramids were considered a wonder of the world by ancient writers.</p><p>(6) The system used a sled attached to wooden posts by ropes overlaying a central ramp, according to Yannis Gourdon, one of the co-directors of the dig. (7)&nbsp;Nearby tool marks and inscriptions were dated to the reign of the pharaoh Khufu, who ordered the construction of the Great Pyramid in Giza.

(10) For one thing, the quarry where the ramp was found was used to mine alabaster.

(12)&nbsp;Alabaster is a softer and lighter mineral than many of the stones used to build the pyramids, and the same techniques might not have worked on more imposing stone blocks.

Kennedy  </em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I have some very sad news for all of you, and, I think,  sad news for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world; and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight in Memphis, Tennessee.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings. He died in the cause of that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it's perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For those of you who are black -- considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible -- you can be filled with bitterness, and with hatred, and a desire for revenge.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization -- black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another. Or we can make an effort, as Martin Luther King did, to understand, and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion, and love.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with -- be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But we have to make an effort in the United States. We have to make an effort to understand, to get beyond, or go beyond these rather difficult times. My favorite poem, my -- my favorite poet was Aeschylus. And he once wrote:</p> <blockquote>Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget<br/>falls drop by drop upon the heart,<br/>until, in our own despair,<br/>against our will,<br/>comes wisdom<br/>through the awful grace of God.</blockquote> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.</p> <p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So I ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King -- yeah, it's true -- but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love -- a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which I spoke.</p> <p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We can do well in this country. We will have difficult times. We've had difficult times in the past, but we -- and we will have difficult times in the future. It is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it's not the end of disorder.</p> <p><em>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land.</p> <p><em>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And let's dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world. Let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people.</p> <p><em>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Thank you very much.</p>",

(6)&nbsp;The typical sleep cycle for teenagers begins at 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when their bodies release melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone.

Moments before, I'd removed my hiking boots and the left one had fallen into those trees, first catapulting into the air when my enormous backpack toppled onto it, then skittering across the gravelly trail and flying over the edge. It bounced off of a rocky outcropping several feet beneath me before disappearing into the forest canopy below, impossible to retrieve. I let out a stunned gasp, though I'd been in the wilderness thirty-eight days and by then I'd come to know that anything could happen and that everything would. But that doesn't mean I wasn't shocked when it did. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>My boot was gone. Actually gone. </p> I clutched its mate to my chest like a baby, though of course it was futile. What is one boot without the other boot? It is nothing. It is useless, an orphan forevermore, and I could take no mercy on it. It was a big lug of a thing, of genuine heft, a brown leather Raichle boot with a red lace and silver metal fasts. I lifted it high and threw it with all my might and watched it fall into the lush trees and out of my life. <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I was alone. I was barefoot. I was twenty-six years old and an orphan too. <em>An actual stray</em>, a stranger had observed a couple of weeks before, when I'd told him my name and explained how very loose I was in the world. My father left my life when I was six. My mother died when I was twenty-two. In the wake of her death, my stepfather morphed from the person I considered my dad into a man I only occasionally recognized. My two siblings scattered in their grief, in spite of my efforts to hold us together, until I gave up and scattered as well.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the years before I pitched my boot over the edge of that mountain, l\u2019d been pitching myself over the edge too. I'd ranged and roamed and railed \u2014 from Minnesota to New York to Oregon and all across the West \u2014 until at last I found myself, bootless, in the summer of 1995, not so much loose in the world as bound to it.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was a world I'd never been to and yet had known was there all along, one I'd staggered to in sorrow and confusion and fear and hope. A world I thought would both make me into the woman I knew I could become and turn me back into the girl I'd once been. A world that measured two feet wide and 2,663 miles long.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A world called the Pacific Crest Trail. </p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I'd first heard of it only seven months before, when I was living in Minneapolis, sad and desperate and on the brink of divorcing a man I still loved. I'd been standing in line at an outdoor store waiting to purchase a foldable shovel when I picked up a book called <em>The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume I; California</em> from a nearby shelf and read the back cover. The PCT, it said, was a continuous wilderness trail that went from the Mexican border in California to just beyond the Canadian border along the crest of nine mountain ranges \u2014 the Laguna, San Jacinto, San Bernardino, San Gabriel, Liebre, Tehachapi, Sierra Nevada, Klamath, and Cascades. That distance was a thousand miles as the crow flies, but the trail was more than double that. Traversing the entire length of the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, the PCT passes through national parks and wilderness areas as well as federal, tribal, and privately held lands; through deserts and mountains and rain forests; across rivers and highways. I turned the book over and gazed at its front cover \u2014 a boulder-strewn lake surrounded by rocky crags against a blue sky \u2014 then placed it back on the shelf, paid for my shovel, and left.</p> <p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But later I returned and bought the book. The Pacific Crest Trail wasn't a world to me then. It was an idea, vague and outlandish, full of promise and mystery. Something bloomed inside me as I traced its jagged line with my finger on a map.</p>",

It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free. And when Americans are sent to Viet-Nam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only. It ought to be possible, therefore, for American students of any color to attend any public institution they select without having to be backed up by troops. It ought to be possible, in short, for every American to enjoy the privileges of being American without regard to his race or his color. But this is not the case. </p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The Negro baby born in America today, regardless of the section of the Nation in which he is born, has about one-half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same day, one-third as much chance of completing college, one-third as much chance of becoming a professional man, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, about one-seventh as much chance of earning $10,000 a year, a life expectancy which is 7 years shorter, and the prospects of earning only half as much. </p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is not a sectional issue. Difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city, in every State of the Union, producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens the public safety. Nor is this a partisan issue. In a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics. This is not even a legal or legislative issue alone. It is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets, and new laws are needed at every level, but law alone cannot make men see right.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated. If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay? </p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is not enough to pin the blame on others, to say this is a problem of one section of the country or another, or deplore the fact that we face. A great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all. Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality. </p> <p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>My fellow Americans, this is a problem which faces us all--in every city of the North as well as the South. It seems to me that these are matters which concern us all, not merely Presidents or Congressmen or Governors, but every citizen of the United States.</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>The Call of the Wild, Wallace Stegner</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I spent my childhood and youth in wild, unsupervised places, and was awed very early, and never recovered. I think it must have happened when I was five years old, in 1914, the year my family moved to the remote valley of the Frenchman River,  in Saskatchewan. The town was not yet born--we were among the first fifty people mink, coyotes, lynx, bobcats, rabbits, and birds inhabited the willow breaks. During my half dozen years there, I shot the rabbits and trapped the furbearers, as other frontier boys have done\u2026 But it is not my predatory experiences that I cherish. I regret them. What I most remember is certain moments, revelations, epiphanies, in which the sensuous little savage that I then was came face to face with the universe. And blinked. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I remember a night when I was very new there, when some cowboys from the Z-X hitched a team to a bobsled and hauled a string of us on our coasting sleds out to the Swift Current hill...We dragged our sled to the top of the hill and shot down, blind with speed and snow, and warmed ourselves a minute at the fire, and plowed  up the hill for another run. It was a night of still cold, zero or so, with a full moon-- a night of pure magic. I remember finding myself alone at the top of the hill, looking down at the dark moving spots of coasters, and the red fire with black figures around it down at the bottom. It isn\u2019t a memory so much as a vision--I don\u2019t remember it, I see it. I see the valley, and the curving course of the river with its  scratches of leafless willows. I see the moon reflecting upward from a reach of wind-blown clear ice, and the white humps of the hills, and the sky like polished metal, and the moon; and behind or in front of or mixed with the moonlight, pulsing with a kind of life, the paled, washed-out green and red of the northern lights. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I stood there by myself, my hands numb, my face still with cold, my nose running, and I felt very small and insignificant and quelled, but at the same time exalted. Greenland\u2019s icy mountains, and myself at their center, one little spark of suffering warmth in the midst of all that inhuman clarity.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And I remember that evening spent on the big empty plains that Sherwood Anderson wrote about. In June of 1915 my father took my brother and me with  him in the wagon across fifty miles of unpeopled prairie to build a house on our homestead. We were heavily loaded, the wagon was heavy and the team lights, and our mare Daisy had a young foal that had a hard time keeping up. All day we plodded across nearly trackless buffalo grass in dust and heat, under siege from mosquitoes and horseflies. We lunched beside a slough where in the shallow water we ignorantly chased and captured a couple of baby mallards. Before I let mine go, I felt the thumping of that wild little heart in my hands, and that taught me something too. Night overtook us, and we camped on the trails. Five gaunt coyotes watched us eat supper, and later serenaded us. I went to sleep to their music.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Then in the night I awoke, not knowing where I was. Strangeness flowed around me; there was a current of cool air, a whispering, a loom of darkness overhead. In panic I reared up on my elbow and found that I was sleeping besides my brother under the wagon, and that night wind was breathing across me through the spokes of the wheel. It came from unimaginably far places, across a vast emptiness, below millions of polished stars. And yet its touch was soft, intimate, and reassuring, and  my panic went away at once. That wind knew me. I knew it. Every once in a while, sixty-six years after that baptism in space and night and silence, wind across grassland can smell like that to me, as secret, perfumed, and soft, and tell me who I am.</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>Evicted, Matthew Desmond</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If we acknowledge that housing is a basic right of all Americans, then we must think differently about another right: the right to make as much money as possible by providing families with housing\u2014and especially to profit excessively from the less fortunate. Since the founding of this country, a long line of American visionaries have called for a more balanced relationship, one that protects people from the profit motive, \u201cnot to destroy individualism,\u201d in Franklin D. Roosevelt's words, \u201cbut to protect it.\u201d<sup>1</sup> Child labor laws, the minimum wage,  workplace safety regulations, and other protections we now take for granted came about when we chose to place the well-being of people above money.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There are losers and winners. There are losers because there are winners. \u201cEvery condition exists,\u201d Martin Luther King Jr. once wrote, \u201csimply because someone profits by its existence. This economic exploitation is crystallized in the slum.\u201d<sup>2</sup> </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Exploitation. Now, there's a word that has been scrubbed out of the poverty debate.<sup>3</sup> It is a word that speaks to the fact that poverty is not just a product of low incomes. It is also a product of extractive markets. Boosting poor people's incomes by increasing the minimum wage or public benefits, say, is absolutely crucial. But not all of those extra dollars will stay in the pockets of the poor. Wage hikes are tempered if rents rise along with them, just as food stamps are worth less if groceries in the inner city cost more\u2014and they do, as much as 40 percent   more, by one estimate.<sup>4</sup> Poverty is two-faced\u2014a matter of income and expenses, input and output-and in a world of exploitation, it will not be effectively ameliorated if we ignore this plain fact.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>History testifies to this point. When the American labor movement rose up in the 1830s to demand higher wages, landed capital did not lock arms with industrial capital. Instead landlords rooted for the workers because higher wages would allow them to collect higher rents. History repeated itself 100 years later, when  wage gains that workers had made through labor strikes were quickly absorbed by rising rents. In the interwar years, the industrial job market expanded, but the housing market, especially for blacks, did not, allowing landlords to recoup workers' income gains. Today, if evictions are lowest each February, it is because many members of the city's working poor dedicate some or all of their Earned Income Tax Credit to pay back rent. In many cases, this annual benefit is as much a boost to landlords as to low income working families.<sup>5</sup> In fixating almost exclusively on what poor people and their communities lack\u2014good jobs, a strong safety net, role models \u2014we have neglected the critical ways that exploitation contributes to the persistence of poverty. We have overlooked a fact that landlords never have: there is a lot of money to be made off the poor.<sup>6</sup> The 'hood is good.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Exploitation thrives when it comes to the essentials, like housing and food. Most of the 12 million Americans who take out high interest payday loans do so not to buy luxury items or cover unexpected expenses but to pay the rent or gas bill, buy food, or meet other regular expenses. Payday loans are but one of many financial techniques\u2014from overdraft fees to student loans for for-profit colleges specifically designed to pull money from the pockets of the poor.<sup>7</sup> If the poor pay more for their housing, food, durable goods, and credit, and if they get smaller returns on their educations and mortgages (if they get returns at all), then their incomes are even smaller than they appear. This is fundamentally unfair.</p><hr/><small><sup>1</sup>  Quoted in Cass Sunstein, The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More Than Ever (New York: Basic Books, 2004), 3.</small><br> <small><sup>2</sup>  Quoted in Beryl Satter, Family Properties: How the Struggle over Race and Real Estate Transformed Chicago and Urban America (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2009), 215.</small><br> <small><sup>3</sup> \"Exploitation\" appears but twice in William Julius Wilson's The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy, 2nd ed.

In Lo\u00efc Wacquant's Urban Outcasts: A Comparative Sociology of Advanced Marginality (Malden, MA: Polity Press, 2008), you can find four instances of \"exploitation,\" only one of which refers to the exploitation of the poor by the rich (page 123n7). The word makes a single appearance in Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton's American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993), on page 176, in reference to sexual liaisons between inner-city residents; a single appearance in Sudhir Venkatesh's American Project: The Rise and Fall of a Modern Ghetto (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), on page 150, in reference to housing project tenants being exploited by gangs; and a single appearance in Harrington's The Other America (page 32). \u201cExploitation\u201d does not appear at all in the pages of many other modern classics that take up the plight of the poor, from Kathryn Edin and Laura Lein's Making Ends Meet: How Single Mothers Survive Welfare and Low-Wage Work (New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1997) to Charles Murray's Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010 (New York: Random House, 2012).</small> <br><small><sup>4</sup>   On food prices in poor neighborhoods, see Chanjin Chung and Samuel Myers, \u201cDo the Poor Pay More for Food?

Of all people, Daniel Patrick Moynihan recognized the central importance of exploitation to understanding racialized urban poverty. In his report to the US Department of Labor that would later become infamous, Moynihan wrote: \u201cThe Negro situation is commonly perceived by whites in terms of the visible manifestation of discrimination and poverty....It is more difficult, however, for whites to perceive the effect that three centuries of exploitation have had on the fabric of Negro society itself....Here is where the true injury has occurred: unless this damage is repaired, all the effort to end discrimination and poverty and injustice will come to little.\u201d Daniel Patrick Moynihan, The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (Washington, DC: US Department of Labor, 1965).</small><br> <small><sup>6</sup>  This point is indebted to Satter's Family Properties.</small> <br><small><sup>7</sup> On rip-off schemes, see Alan Andreasen, The Disadvantaged Consumer (New York: The Free Press, 1975); Michael Lewis, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine (New York: Norton, 2010), 20; David Caplovitz, The Poor Pay More (New York: The Free Press, 1967).

It is acknowledged that they spend many of the first years of their lives in acquiring a smattering of accomplishments; meanwhile strength of body and mind are sacrificed to libertine notions of beauty, to the desire of establishing themselves, \u2013 the only way women can rise in the world, \u2013 by marriage. And this desire making mere animals of them, when they marry they act as such children may be expected to act: \u2013 they dress; they paint, and nickname God\u2019s creatures. \u2013 Surely these weak beings are only fit for a seraglio! \u2013 Can they be expected to govern a family with judgment, or take care of the poor babies whom they bring into the world?</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>If then it can be fairly deduced from the present conduct of the sex, from the prevalent fondness for pleasure which take place of ambition and those nobler passions that open and enlarge the soul; that the instruction which women have hitherto received has only tended, with the constitution of civil society, to render them insignificant objects of desire \u2013 mere propagators of fools! \u2013 if it can be proved that in aiming to accomplish them, without cultivating their understandings, they are taken out of their sphere of duties, and made ridiculous and useless when their short-lived bloom of beauty is over,  I presume that <em>rational</em> men will excuse me for endeavouring to persuade them to become more masculine and respectable.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Indeed the word masculine is only a bugbear: there is little reason to fear that women will acquire too much courage or fortitude; for their apparent inferiority with respect to bodily strength, must render them, in some degree, dependent on men in the various relations of life, but why should it be increased by prejudices that give a sex to virtue, and confound simple truths with sensual reveries?</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Women are, in fact, so much degraded by mistaken notions of female excellence, that I do not mean to add a paradox when I assert, that this artificial weakness produces a propensity to tyrannize, and gives birth to cunning, the natural opponent of strength, which leads them to play off those contemptible infantine airs that undermine esteem even whilst they excite desire. Let men become more chaste and modest, and if women do not grow wiser in the same ratio, it will be clear that they have weaker understandings. It seems scarcely necessary to say, that I now speak of the sex in general. Many individuals have more sense than their male relatives; and, as nothing preponderates where there is a constant struggle or an equilibrium, without it has naturally more gravity, some women govern their husbands without degrading themselves, because intellect will always govern.</p>",

It is that the people who are going to be interested in such a book are also the people who are least going to need it, i.e., that offering counsel on the finer points of U.S. English is Preaching to the Choir. The relevant Choir here comprises that small percentage of American citizens who actually care about the current status of double modals and ergative verbs. The same sorts of people who watched Story of English on PBS (twice) and read W. Safire's column with their half-caff every Sunday. The sorts of people who feel that special blend of wincing despair and sneering superiority when they see EXPRESS LANE--10 ITEMS OR LESS or hear dialogue used as a verb or realize that the founders of the Super 8 motel chain must surely have been ignorant of the meaning of suppurate. There are lots of epithets for people like this--Grammar Nazis, Usage Nerds, Syntax Snobs, the Language Police. The term I was raised with is SNOOT. The word might be slightly self-mocking, but those other terms are outright dysphemisms. A SNOOT can be defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and doesn't mind letting you know it. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I submit that we SNOOTs are just about the last remaining kind of truly elitist nerd. There are, granted, plenty of nerd-species in today's America, and some of these are elitist within their own nerdy purview (e.g., the skinny, carbuncular, semi-autistic Computer Nerd moves instantly up on the totem pole of status when your screen freezes and now you need his help, and the bland condescension with which he performs the two occult keystrokes that unfreeze your screen is both elitist and situationally valid). But the SNOOT's purview is interhuman social life itself. You don't, after all (despite withering cultural pressure), have to use a computer, but you can't escape language: Language is everything and everywhere; it's what lets us have anything to do with one another; it's what separates us from the animals; Genesis 11:7-10 and so on. And we SNOOTS know when and how to hyphenate phrasal adjectives and to keep participles from dangling, and we know that we know, and we know how very few other Americans know this stuff or even care, and we judge them accordingly.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In ways that certain of us are uncomfortable about, SNOOTs' attitudes about contemporary usage resemble religious/political conservatives' attitudes about contemporary culture: We combine a missionary zeal and a near-neural faith in our beliefs' importance with a curmudgeonly hell-in-a-handbasket despair at the way English is routinely manhandled and corrupted by supposedly educated people. The Evil is all around us: boners and clunkers and solecistic howlers and bursts of voguish linguistic methane that make any SNOOT's cheek twitch and forehead darken. A fellow SNOOT I know likes to say that listening to most people's English feels like watching somebody use a Stradivarius to pound nails. We are the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Issues of tradition vs. egalitarianism in U.S. English are at root political issues and can be effectively addressed only in what this article hereby terms a \"Democratic Spirit.\" A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel strongly about. Equally tough is a D.S.'s criterion of 100 percent intellectual integrity--you have to be willing to look honestly at yourself and your motives for believing what you believe, and to do it more or less continually.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This kind of stuff is advanced U.S. citizenship. A true Democratic Spirit is up there with religious faith and emotional maturity and all those other top-of-the-Maslow-Pyramid-type qualities people spend their whole lives working on. A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over them. </p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I submit, then, that it is indisputably easier to be dogmatic than Democratic, especially about issues that are both vexed and highly charged. I submit further that the issues surrounding \"correctness\" in contemporary American usage are both vexed and highly charged, and that the fundamental questions they involve are ones whose answers have to be \"worked out\" instead of simply found.

There was the smart kids\u2019 class, and there was the dumb kids\u2019 class.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It was the same in all three of the parochial schools I attended. My family moved twice: from Glen Ellyn, where I attended St. Petronille\u2019s through sixth grade; to Port Washington, Long Island, where I attended St. Peter of Alcantara for seventh grade. After a year, we left Long Island for Maryland, where I attended eighth grade at St. Joseph\u2019s, in Cockeysville. These were formative years, from age 11 to 14, from boyhood to adolescence. And both times we moved, I began the school year in the dumb kids\u2019 class. Judging by my yellowed report cards, it\u2019s safe to say that the nuns at St. Petronille\u2019s had been merely whelmed by my potential. Since the nuns at the new schools had never met me, they decided to start me in the class where expectations might be more easily met. [...]</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Dumb kids were tougher than smart kids, as a rule. You didn\u2019t last long on the playground with the dumb kids if you were unwilling to take a swing at somebody, or were too afraid of getting hit. I was not particularly brave, or tough, but I had fallen off my bike at a young age and, to my mother\u2019s horror, broken one of my front teeth. Thankfully, this was before the age of universal cosmetic dentistry in America. Throughout grade school, my broken tooth gave me a degree of rough-and-tumble cred that was as invaluable as it was false. I had also observed\u2014and moving from school to school gives a kid a broad sample\u2014that you usually had to hit somebody only once to be considered dangerous enough to be left alone. Drawing blood guaranteed actual respect. At St. Joseph\u2019s, a popular activity was humiliating the weak kids by dropping them into the \u201cspit pit,\u201d an outdoor stairwell that led down to the school\u2019s basement. Victims would be spat upon as they tried to escape up the steps. I bloodied the mouth of the first bully who suggested such a fate for me, immediately claiming the status of legendary playground thug.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Such were the invaluable lessons of the dumb kids\u2019 class. So when the nuns promoted me to the smart kids\u2019 class midway through the school year, I had the best of both worlds. Overnight, I was anointed with academic potential, a designation all the more meaningful because I had earned it. Arriving with my broken tooth and dumb-kid rep, I instantly became the most feared and respected student in my new classroom. It was too much success for a 12-year-old to handle. Soon after my first elevation, I remember my new seventh-grade teacher roughly pulling me aside on the playground and announcing that my head was so big, she wished she could \u201cjust pop it with a pin!\u201d This was a disturbing concept, and still occasionally visits my dreams: a towering, wrathful nun, pink face wrapped and pinched in starched white linen, wielding a huge pin pulled from some obscure corner of her habit. This was the closest any of the good sisters ever came to abusing me, if you don\u2019t count the F\u00e1tima message. Still, given my swaggering self-importance, she showed saintly restraint.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I relished my role as the bad boy among the goody-goodies. Once, in the second half of eighth grade, our nun, a kindly old soul, fell asleep at her desk while I was reading aloud the answers to the previous night\u2019s homework from her teachers\u2019 edition of our math book. She would award this privilege to a student who had performed especially well on a test, so what I did next was abject betrayal. Before nudging her back to awareness, I read out the answers to the next few homework assignments. This was the kind of thing a dumb kid did without thinking, but among the smart kids, it was considered daring and ingenious.</p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The combined efforts of Saints Petronille, Peter, and Joseph failed to make me a religious man, but my Catholic-school years shaped me in many ways. The nuns taught us to think about big things, about the whole sweep of life and death and right and wrong. Such thoughts could be disturbing, but they were valuable. The nuns taught us that the capacity for evil is real and present in this world, especially inside ourselves. They taught us to at least consider the moral implications of our actions and ideas, and they showed us that real goodness is in giving up something not when doing so is easy, but when it is hard.

        "text": "<span><em>English Is Not Normal, John McWhorter</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>English speakers know that their language is odd. So do people saddled with learning it non-natively. The oddity that we all perceive most readily is its spelling, which is indeed a nightmare. In countries where English isn\u2019t spoken, there is no such thing as a \u2018spelling bee\u2019 competition. For a normal language, spelling at least pretends a basic correspondence to the way people pronounce the words. But English is not normal. Spelling is a matter of writing, of course, whereas language is fundamentally about speaking. Speaking came long before writing, we speak much more, and all but a couple of hundred of the world\u2019s thousands of languages are rarely or never written. Yet even in its spoken form, English is weird. It\u2019s weird in ways that are easy to miss, especially since Anglophones in the United States and Britain are not exactly rabid to learn other languages. But our monolingual tendency leaves us like the proverbial fish not knowing that it is wet. Our language feels \u2018normal\u2019 only until you get a sense of what normal really is.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There is no other language, for example, that is close enough to English that we can get about half of what people are saying without training and the rest with only modest effort. German and Dutch are like that, as are Spanish and Portuguese, or Thai and Lao. The closest an Anglophone can get is with the obscure Northern European language called Frisian: if you know that <em>tsiis</em> is cheese and <em>Frysk</em> is Frisian, then it isn\u2019t hard to figure out what this means: <em>Brea, b\u00fbter, en griene tsiis is goed Ingelsk en goed Frysk</em>. But that sentence is a cooked one, and overall, we tend to find that Frisian seems more like German, which it is.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We think it\u2019s a nuisance that so many European languages assign gender to nouns for no reason, with French having female moons and male boats and such. But actually, it\u2019s us who are odd: almost all European languages belong to one family \u2013 Indo-European \u2013 and of all of them, English is the only one that <em>doesn\u2019t</em> assign genders that way.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>More weirdness? OK. There is exactly one language on Earth whose present tense requires a special ending only in the third\u2011person singular. I\u2019m writing in it. <em>I talk, you talk, he/she talk-s</em> \u2013 why just that? The present\u2011tense verbs of a normal language have either no endings or a bunch of different ones (Spanish: <em>hablo, hablas, habla</em>). And try naming another language where you have to slip do into sentences to negate or question something. <em>Do</em> you find that difficult? Unless you happen to be from Wales, Ireland or the north of France, probably. [...]</p>",

(2) Psychologists Jessie Sun and Simine Vazire at the University of California, Davis, have shown that while people offer accurate self-assessments of many individual traits, they tend to miss when they are being rude to others. (3) As it turns out, knowing what your personality is generally like is not the same as accurately discerning how you are behaving in the moment\u2014an important distinction when it comes to treating other people considerately.</p><p>(4) According to Sun and Vazire, self-knowledge can be divided into trait self-knowledge and state self-knowledge\u2014in other words, knowledge of your own characteristics as opposed to \u201cknowledge of how your personality fluctuates from moment to moment.\u201d (5) Sun and Vazire conspired on an experiment to study the latter category. (6) The study\u2019s experimental subjects were equipped with audio recorders that would automatically activate every 9.5 minutes during the day, recording thirty seconds of audio at each activation. (7)&nbsp;Participants completed self-evaluations at certain times of day according to several different personality measurements: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism.</p><p>(8) The self-assessments and the ratings of objective observers generally aligned. (9)&nbsp;But Sun and Vazire noticed some major differences among different categories of personality traits. (10)&nbsp;Participants often reported feeling more neurotic\u2014anxious or worried\u2014than the observers believed.

And we formed it, not to give the blessings of liberty, but to secure them; not to the half of ourselves and the half of our posterity, but to the whole people \u2013 women as well as men. And it is a downright mockery to talk to women of their enjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they are denied the use of the only means of securing them provided by this democratic-republican government \u2013 the ballot.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For any state to make sex a qualification that must ever result in the disfranchisement of one entire half of the people, is to pass a bill of attainder, or, an ex post facto law, and is therefore a violation of the supreme law of the land. By it the blessings of liberty are forever withheld from women and their female posterity.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>To them this government has no just powers derived from the consent of the governed. To them this government is not a democracy. It is not a republic. It is an odious aristocracy; a hateful oligarchy of sex; the most hateful aristocracy ever established on the face of the globe; an oligarchy of wealth, where the rich govern the poor. An oligarchy of learning, where the educated govern the ignorant, or even an oligarchy of race, where the Saxon rules the African, might be endured; but this oligarchy of sex, which makes father, brothers, husband, sons, the oligarchs over the mother and sisters, the wife and daughters, of every household - which ordains all men sovereigns, all women subjects, carries dissension, discord, and rebellion into every home of the nation. </p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Webster, Worcester, and Bouvier all define a Citizen to be a person in the United States, entitled to vote and hold office. </p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no state has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities. Hence, every discrimination against women in the constitutions and laws of the several states is today null and void, precisely as is every one against Negroes.</p>",

We tend to assume that knowledge once discovered stays discovered, but much can happen to knowledge in thousand years, particularly in as politically unstable a region as this. For example, sophisticated building techniques used routinely by the Romans were unknown to even the most brilliant architects and builders in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, and were being discovered as though for the first time as late as the fifteenth century. Knowledge of a thirty-geared, hand-operated mechanical computer known as the Antikythera Mechanism used by the Hellenistic Greeks in 150-100 B.C., and the technological understanding necessary to manufacture and use it, were likewise lost, and a thousand years passed before anyone can even thought of the possibility of such an invention again. The tablets at Shaduppum disappeared in the rubble before 1600 B.C. and were, in the time of Pythagoras, lying right where archaeologists would find them in the twentieth century A.D.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There are very few school mathematics tablets dating from 1600-1350 B.C., and another evidential gap 1100-800 B.C.

        "text": "<span><em>A Critic's Manifesto,  Daniel Mendelsohn</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Two phenomena related to the advent of the Internet have transformed our thinking about reviewing and criticism in particular. First, there has been the explosion of criticism and reviews by ordinary readers, in forums ranging from the simple rating (by means of stars, or whatever) of books on sites such as Amazon.com to serious longform review-essays by deeply committed lit bloggers. For the first time, ordinary readers (or ballet fans or architecture aficionados) have been able to express their opinions about books (or ballet, or architecture) publicly. This development inevitably raises questions about the role of the traditional critic. (\u201cWhy should we listen to X, when we can say what we think?\u201d) Second, and more recently, the advent of social media\u2014Facebook, for instance, with the possibility it offers of \u201cliking\u201d but not \u201cdisliking\u201d; Twitter, which lends itself so easily to vacuous promotional exchanges of likes, links, and \u201cfavorites\u201d\u2014has created an environment of what the journalist Jacob Silverman, in an article for Slate called \u201cAgainst Enthusiasm\u201d (one cloudburst in the recent storm) has called \u201csolicitous communalism,\u201d an atmosphere not conducive to serious critique.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But just what is \u201cserious critique\u201d? One of the main points of the controversy that has arisen since the two Times Book Review reviews has been, indeed, about the relative merits of positive and negative reviewing. Silverman, along with the Times daily book critic Dwight Garner, have argued for the vivifying role of negative reviews, which, as Silverman put it, make for a \u201cvibrant, useful literary culture.\u201d Against them have been ranged an array of prominent journalists and critics. One amusing response was that of Jane Hu, in The Awl, which took the form of a brief history of the \u201ccriticism-used-to-be-much-tougher-and-more-incisive\u201d trope in contemporary literary debate\u2014a line, as she slyly shows, that is at least as old as the \u201cgolden age\u201d of feisty book reviewing about which writers like Silverman and Garner are so nostalgic.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>These critics are motivated by lively and serious concerns, some of them abstract, some practical: Garner\u2019s and Silverman\u2019s desire for lively literary debate, Miller\u2019s commitment to publishing criticism that people will actually read, and Brody\u2019s passionate worry that glib negativity can have destructive effects on the career of serious artists. But some of these concerns\u2014not least, the dilemma of how to steer between the Scylla of vapid negativity and the Charybdis of vacuous cheerleading\u2014become moot when you think back to the impulse that lies behind serious criticism: the impulse to analyze, to explain, to teach, to judge meaningfully.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The serious critic cannot be a monomaniacal controversialist. Hatchet jobs, especially when directed at over-hyped and unworthy objects, can be both entertaining and useful. Particularly in a culture that is awash in hype and promotion (both professional and, as Garner and Silverman pointed out, amateur\u2014the culture of reflexive boosterism), a vital function of the critic is to peel away the swoony publisher\u2019s hype, the self-congratulation of an author\u2019s Twitter feed, and to reorient the conversation to where it belongs: the work and its merits and flaws, as judged against genuine knowledge and disinterested taste. That said, if hatchet jobs are all you write, your audience will soon perceive that the writing is somehow about you\u2014your enjoyment of ridicule or nasty flamboyance or snark\u2014and not about the work. There is usually something to like in even the weakest work\u2014just as there is nearly always some weakness in the strongest work; most reviews, if anything, should be somewhat mixed. (It may be a sign of how harmful the culture of reflexive \u201cliking\u201d has become that what are, in fact, mixed reviews are denounced as if they were take-downs.) The serious critic, as Richard Brody rightly pointed out, should first of all self-criticize: he should begin by examining his own reactions, when they are negative, and determine that they are legitimate\u2014which is to say, should avoid writing about things or artists for whom he has a distaste that is not motivated by aesthetic considerations.</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>A Bad Day for Grendel, by Anthony Esolen</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>A few years ago, a vandal seized some forty or fifty thousand books from my college\u2019s library. He didn\u2019t want to read them, or even to sell them. He wanted  simply to get rid of them, on the grounds that nobody would read them anyway. Some of the volumes he had branded for destruction were irreplaceable. I know,  because I went into the back room where they were being held temporarily before the trucks came to haul them away. From that room I saved several dozen, including a definitive dictionary of medieval Latin, and the first great grammar book for Anglo-Saxon\u2014you know, the language that Beowulf spoke on the night when he was tearing Grendel\u2019s arm off, and the monster knew that his end was near. \u201cThat was not a good day for Grendel,\u201d says the poet, deadpan. It was not  a good day for the books, either. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There wasn\u2019t much we could do about it, because the vandal in question made more money than we did and had a nicer office. He was our librarian. It\u2019s ironic,  but true, that one of the qualifications of the modern librarian is a distaste for  books. They take up space, and space, the librarians complain, is limited. The  books grow old, too. Their covers fray, the spines crack, the pages go dog-eared.  Inattentive student workers stick them on the wrong shelves, where they can  practically \u201cdisappear\u201d for years. People borrow them and don\u2019t return them.  Some people\u2014I\u2019m guilty of this\u2014underline favorite passages, or write wry  comments in the margins, so that the book eventually becomes a kind of  successive crime scene. Here a priest wrote, \u201cThis is the modernist heresy all  over again,\u201d but over there an infidel wrote, \u201cChurch, enemy of thought.\u201d That is  not to mention fingerprints and inkblots and even bloodstains\u2014from crushed  mosquitoes, I guess. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Books are bulky and inconvenient\u2014like rocks, and trees, and rivers, and life.  It occurs to me that everything that can be said against the inconvenience of  books can be said about the inconvenience of children. They too take up space,  are of no immediate practical use, are of interest to only a few people, and  present all kinds of problems. They too must be warehoused efficiently, and  brought with as little resistance as possible into the Digital Age. And there is  the trouble. A good book is a dangerous thing. In the wrong hands, it is like a  bomb housed within a couple of red pasteboard covers. It can blow the world   wide open; it can, if it\u2019s Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, blow the reader as high as   heaven. It carries within it the possibility\u2014and it is always only a possibility\u2014of cracking open the shell of routine that prevents us from seeing the world.  Our days pass by with the regularity of a conveyor belt at an airport, which we  duly get on, and make our way with bland uniformity. A book is like a mischievous  boy sticking out his foot at the end of the belt, or like some fantastic intellectual  machine that jolts us awake, and we find that the belt is gone. Instead, we\u2019re  riding in a stagecoach on a trail of dry ruts, and half-naked Indians are  surrounding us from the hills, bows stretched and arrows picked to fly.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Suppose you are a lover of books. You will not say, \u201cAh, books, yes, books are  wonderful. Such treasures, books are! Myself, I don\u2019t have any, and I don\u2019t want  any, or maybe just one, but I so love books!\u201d Why, you would have books strewn  about your flat. You would delight in their very bindings and the smell of their  pages. You would not know what to do without them. You would not say, \u201cYes, I  love books. That is why I have warehoused them in this special room, far away  from company, and far from where I do anything of importance. I keep them  locked up behind this glass case, and only take them out on special occasions.\u201d  You would not say, \u201cBooks indeed, our greatest resource. They kindle readily,  and make excellent bonfires.\u201d</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>Obstructions of Learning, Samuel Johnson</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is common to find young men ardent and diligent in the pursuit of knowledge; but the  progress of life very often produces laxity and indifference; and not only those who are   at liberty to choose their business and amusements, but those likewise whose  professions engage them in literary inquiries, pass the latter part of their time without  improvement, and spend the day rather in any other entertainment than that which they  might find among their books.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This abatement of the vigour of curiosity is sometimes imputed to the insufficiency of  learning. Men are supposed to remit their labours, because they find their labours to   have been vain; and to search no longer after truth and wisdom, because they at last  despair of finding them.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But this reason is, for the most part, very falsely assigned. Of learning, as of virtue, it may   be affirmed, that it is at once honoured and neglected. Whoever forsakes it will for ever  look after it with longing, lament the loss which he does not endeavour to repair, and  desire the good which he wants resolution to seize and keep. The Idler never applauds  his own idleness, nor does any man repent of the diligence of his youth.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So many hindrances may obstruct the acquisition of knowledge, that there is little   reason for wondering that it is in a few hands. To the greater part of mankind the duties   of life are inconsistent with much study; and the hours which they would spend upon  letters must be stolen from their occupations and their families. Many suffer themselves  to be lured by more sprightly and luxurious pleasures from the shades of contemplation,  where they find seldom more than a calm delight, such as, though greater than all others,  its certainty and its duration being reckoned with its power of gratification, is yet easily  quitted for some extemporary joy, which the present moment offers, and another,   perhaps, will put out of reach.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is the great excellence of learning, that it borrows very little from time or place; it is not  confined to season or to climate, to cities or to the country, but may be cultivated and  enjoyed where no other pleasure can be obtained. But this quality, which constitutes  much of its value, is one occasion of neglect; what may be done at all times with equal   propriety, is deferred from day to day, till the mind is gradually reconciled to the omission,  and the attention is turned to other objects. Thus habitual idleness gains too much power  to be conquered, and the soul shrinks from the idea of intellectual labour and  intenseness of meditation.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>That those who profess to advance learning sometimes obstruct it, cannot be denied; the  continual multiplication of books not only distracts choice, but disappoints inquiry. To  him that has moderately stored his mind with images, few writers afford any novelty, or  what little they have to add to the common stock of learning, is so buried in the mass of   general notions, that, like silver mingled with the ore of lead, it is too little to pay for the  labour of separation; and he that has often been deceived by the promise of a title, at last  grows weary of examining, and is tempted to consider all as equally fallacious.</p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There are indeed some repetitions always lawful, because they never deceive. He that  writes the history of past times, undertakes only to decorate known facts by new  beauties of method or of style, or at most to illustrate them by his own reflections. The  author of a system, whether moral or physical, is obliged to nothing beyond care of  selection and regularity of disposition. But there are others who claim the name of  authors merely to disgrace it, and fill the world with volumes only to bury letters in their  own rubbish. The traveller, who tells, in a pompous folio, that he saw the Pantheon at  Rome, and the Medicean Venus at Florence; the natural historian, who, describing the  productions of a narrow island, recounts all that it has in common with every other part   of the world; the collector of antiquities, that accounts every thing a curiosity which the   ruins of Herculaneum happen to emit, though an instrument already shown in a thousand  repositories, or a cup common to the ancients, the moderns and all mankind; may be   justly censured as the persecutors of students, and the thieves of that time which never   can be restored.</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>The Land of Little Rain, Mary Austin, 1903  </em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>East away from the Sierras, south from Panamint and Amargosa, east and south many an uncounted mile, is The Country of Lost Borders.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Ute, Paiute, Mojave, and Shoshone inhabit its frontiers, and as far into the heart of it as a man dare go. Not the law, but the land sets the limit. Desert is the name it wears upon the maps, but the Indian\u2019s is the better word. Desert is a loose term to indicate land that supports no man; whether the land can be bitted and broken to that purpose is not proven. Void of life it never is, however dry the air and villainous the soil.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This is the nature of that country. There are hills, rounded, blunt, burned, squeezed up out of chaos, chrome and vermilion painted, aspiring to the snow-line. Between the hills lie high level-looking plains full of intolerable sun glare, or narrow valleys drowned in a blue haze. The hill surface is streaked with ash drift and black, unweathered lava flows. After rains water accumulates in the hollows of small closed valleys, and, evaporating, leaves hard dry levels of pure desertness that get the local name of dry lakes. Where the mountains are steep and the rains heavy, the pool is never quite dry, but dark and bitter, rimmed about with the efflorescence of alkaline deposits. A thin crust of it lies along the marsh over the vegetating area, which has neither beauty nor freshness. In the broad wastes open to the wind the sand drifts in hummocks about the stubby shrubs, and between them the soil shows saline traces. The sculpture of the hills here is more wind than water work, though the quick storms do sometimes scar them past many a year\u2019s redeeming. In all the Western desert edges that are essays in miniature at the famed, terrible Grand Canyon, to which, if you keep on long enough in this country, you will come at last.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Since this is a hill country one expect to find springs, but not to depend upon them; for when found they are often brackish and unwholesome, or maddening, slow dribbles in a thirsty soil. Here you find the hot sink of Death Valley, or high rolling districts where the air has always a tang of frost. Here are the long heavy winds and breathless calms on the tilted mesas where dust devils dance, whirling up into a wide, pale sky. Here you have no rain when all the earth cries for it, or quick downpours called cloud-bursts for violence. A land of lost rivers, with little in it to love; yet a land that once visited must come back to inevitably. If it were not so there would be little told of it\u2026.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The palpable sense of mystery in the desert air breeds fables, chiefly of lost treasure. Somewhere within its stark borders, if one believes report, is a hill strewn with nuggets; one seamed with virgin silver; an old clayey water-bed where Indians scooped up earth to make cooking pots and shaped them reeking with grains of pure gold. Old miners drifting about the desert edges, weathered into the semblance of the tawny hills, will tell you tales like these convincingly. After a little sojourn in that land you will believe them on their own account. It is a question whether it is not better to be bitten by the little horned snake of the desert that goes sidewise and strikes without coiling, than by the tradition of a lost mine.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And yet \u2013 and yet \u2013 is it not perhaps to satisfy expectations that one falls into the tragic key in writing of desertness? The more you wish of it the more you get, and in the mean time lost much of pleasantness. In that country which begins at the foot of the east slope of the Sierras and spreads out by less and less lofty hill ranges toward the Great Basin, it is possible to live with great zest, to have red blood and delicate joys, to pass and repass about one\u2019s daily performance an area that would make an Atlantic seaboard State, and that with no peril, and, according to our way of thought, no particular difficulty. At any rate, it was not people who went into the desert merely to write it up who invented the fabled Hassaympa, of whose waters, if any drink, they can no more see fact as naked fact, but all radiant with the color of romance. I, who must have drunk of it in my twice seven years\u2019 wanderings, am assured that it is worth while.</p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>For all the toll the desert takes of a man it gives compensations, deep breaths, deep sleep, and the communion of the stars.  It comes upon one with new force in the pauses of the night that the Chaldeans were a desert-bred people. It is hard to escape the sense of mastery as the stars move in the wide clear heavens to risings and stings unobscured. They look large and near and palpitant; as if they moved on some stately service not needful to declare. Wheeling to their stations in the sky, they make the poor world-fret of no account. Of no account you who lie out there watching, nor the lean coyote that stands off in the scrub from you and howls and howls.</p>",

And they threaten to leave us if we do not continue to do their evil work, as we have hitherto done it, and go down in the dust before them!</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Would to heaven they would go!

There can be no union between us: \"What concord hath Christ with Belial?\" What union has freedom with slavery?

And how easily it might be!</p> <p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What is it that God requires of the South to remove every root of bitterness, to allay every fear, to fill her borders with prosperity? But one simple act of justice, without violence and convulsion, without danger and hazard. It is this: \"Undo the heavy burdens, break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free!\" Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy darkness shall be as the noonday.

Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the  unmarried or childless men; which both in affection and means, have married and endowed the public. Yet it were great reason that those that have children, should have greatest care of future times; unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges. Some there are, who though they lead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with themselves, and account future times impertinences. Nay, there are some other, that account wife and children, but as bills of charges. Nay more, there are some foolish rich covetous men that take a pride, in having no children, because they may be thought so much the richer. For perhaps they have heard some talk, Such an one is a great rich man, and another except to it, Yea, but he hath a great charge of children; as if it were an abatement to his riches. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But the most ordinary cause of a single life, is liberty, especially in certain self-pleasing and humorous minds, which are so sensible of every restraint, as they will go near to think their girdles and garters, to be bonds and shackles. Unmarried men are best friends, best masters, best servants; but not always best subjects; for they are light to run away; and almost all fugitives, are of that condition. A single life doth well with churchmen; for charity will hardly water the ground, where it must first fill a pool. It is indifferent for judges and magistrates; for if they be facile and corrupt, you shall have a servant, five times worse than a wife. For soldiers, I find the generals commonly in their hortatives<sup>1</sup>, put men in mind of their wives and children; and I think the despising of marriage amongst the Turks<sup>2</sup>, maketh the vulgar soldier more base. Certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity; and single men, though they may be many times more charitable, because their means are less exhaust, yet, on the other side, they are more cruel and hardhearted (good to make severe inquisitors), because their tenderness is not so oft called upon. Grave natures, led by custom, and therefore constant, are commonly loving husbands, as was said of Ulysses, vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati<sup>3</sup>. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Chaste women are often proud and forward, as presuming upon the merit of their chastity. It is one of the best bonds, both of chastity and obedience, in the wife, if she think her husband wise; which she will never do, if she find him jealous. Wives are young men's mistresses; companions for middle age; and old men's nurses. So as a man may have a quarrel to marry, when he will. But yet he was reputed one of the wise men, that made answer to the question, when a man should marry,- A young man not yet, an elder man not at all. It is often seen that bad husbands, have very good wives; whether it be, that it raiseth the price of their husband's kindness, when it comes; or that the wives take a pride in their patience. But this never fails, if the bad husbands were of their own choosing, against their friends' consent; for then they will be sure to make good their own folly.</p><hr/><small><sup>1</sup> *hortatives*: expressions meant to encourage action<sup>2</sup> *Turks*: A shorthand reference to those from Turkey, a country often in conflict with nations from Western Europe<sup>3</sup> *vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati*: \u201cHe preferred his old wife to immortality\u201d</small>",

        "text": "<span><em>Excerpt from Universities and Their Function, Alfred North Whitehead, 1928  </em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Imagination is a contagious disease. It cannot be measured by the yard, or weighed by the pound, and then delivered to the students by members of the faculty. It can only be communicated by a faculty whose members themselves wear their learning with imagination. In saying this, I am only repeating one of the oldest of observations. More than two thousand years ago the ancients symbolised learning by a torch passing from hand to hand down the generations. That lighted torch is the imagination of which I speak. The whole art in the organisation of a university is the provision of a faculty whose learning is lighted up with imagination. This is the problem of problems in university education; and unless we are careful the recent vast extension of universities in number of students and in variety of activities \u2014  of which we are so justly proud \u2014 will fail in producing its proper results, by the mishandling of this problem.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The combination of imagination and learning normally requires some leisure, freedom from restraint, freedom from harassing worry, some variety of experiences, and the stimulation of other minds diverse in opinion and diverse in equipment. Also there is required the excitement of curiosity, and the self-confidence derived from pride in the achievements of the surroundingsociety in procuring the advance of knowledge. Imagination cannot be acquired once and for all, and then kept indefinitely in an ice box to be produced periodically in stated quantities. The learned and imaginative life is a way of living, and is not an article of commerce.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is in respect to the provision and utilisation of these conditions for an efficient faculty that the two functions of education and research meet together in a university. Do you want your teachers to be imaginative? Then encourage them to research. Do you want your researchers to be imaginative? Then bring them into intellectual sympathy with the young at the most eager, imaginative period of life, when intellects are just entering upon their mature discipline. Make your researchers explain themselves to active minds, plastic and with the world before them; make your young students crown their period of intellectual acquisition by some contact with minds gifted with experience of intellectual adventure. Education is discipline for the adventure of life; research is intellectual adventure; and the universities should be homes of adventure shared in common by  young and old. For successful education there must always be a certain freshness in the knowledge dealt with. It must either be new in itself or it must be invested with some novelty of application to the new world of new times.  Knowledge does not keep any better than fish. You may be dealing with knowledge of the old species, with some old truth; but some-how or other it must come to the students, as it were, just drawn out of the sea and with the freshness of its immediate importance.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It is the function of the scholar to evoke into life wisdom and beauty which, apart from his magic, would remain lost in the past. A progressive society depends upon its inclusion of three groups: scholars, discoverers, inventors. Its progress also depends upon the fact that its educated masses are composed of members each with a tinge of scholarship, a tinge of discovery, and a tinge of invention. I am here using the term `discovery' to mean the progress of knowledge in respect to truths of some high generality, and the term `invention' to mean the progress of knowledge in respect to the application of general truths in particular ways subservient to present needs. It is evident that these three groups merge into each other, and also that men engaged in practical affairs are properly to be called inventors so far as they contribute to the progress of society. But any one individual has his own limitation of function, and his own peculiar needs. What is important for a nation is that there shall be a very close relation between all types of its progressive elements, so that the study may influence the market place, and the market place the study.

        "text": "<span><em>Tradition and the Individual Talent, T.S. Eliot, 1919  </em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In English writing we seldom speak of tradition, although we occasionally apply its name in deploring its absence. We cannot refer to \u201cthe tradition\u201d or to \u201ca tradition\u201d; at most, we employ the adjective in saying that the poetry of So-and-so is \u201ctraditional\u201d or even \u201ctoo traditional.\u201d Seldom, perhaps, does the word appear except in a phrase of censure. If otherwise, it is vaguely approbative, with the implication, as to the work approved, of some pleasing archaeological reconstruction. You can hardly make the word agreeable to English ears without this comfortable reference to the reassuring science of archaeology.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Certainly the word is not likely to appear in our appreciations of living or dead writers. Every nation, every race, has not only its own creative, but its own critical turn of mind; and is even more oblivious of the shortcomings and limitations of its critical habits than of those of its creative genius. We know, or think we know, from the enormous mass of critical writing that has appeared in the French language the critical method or habit of the French; we only conclude (we are such unconscious people) that the French are \u201cmore critical\u201d than we, and sometimes even plume ourselves a little with the fact, as if the French were less the spontaneous. Perhaps they are; but we might remind ourselves that criticism is as inevitable as breathing, and that we should be none the worse for articulating what passes in our minds when we read a book and feel an emotion about it, for criticizing our own minds in their work of criticism. One of the facts that might come to light in this process is our tendency to insist, when we praise a poet, upon those aspects of his work in which he least resembles any one else. In these aspects or parts of his work we pretend to find what is individual, what is the particular essence of the man. We dwell with satisfaction upon the poet\u2019s difference from his predecessors, especially his immediate predecessors; we endeavor to find something that can be isolated in order to be enjoyed. Whereas if we approach a poet without this prejudice we shall often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of his work may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immorality most vigorously. And I do not mean the impressionable period of adolescence, but the period of full maturity.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yet if the only form of tradition, of handing down, consisted in following the ways of the immediate generation before us in a blind or timid adherence to its successes, \u201ctradition\u201d should positively be discouraged. We have seen many such simple currents soon lost in the sand; and novelty is better than repetition. Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labour. It involves, in the first place, the historical sense, which we may call nearly indispensable to any one who would continue to be a poet beyond his twenty-fifth year; and the historical sense involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence; the historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the  whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order. This historical sense, which is a sense of the timeless as well as of the temporal and of the timeless and of the temporal together, is what makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity.</p>",

(2) In fact, sister-city programs can matter a great deal: civic organizations and local businesses are often involved in sister-city relationships.</p><p>(3) Sister-city partnerships were developed to foster international cooperation after the Second World War, and they continue to serve this purpose today. (4) Many of the earliest relationships were between cities that had previously been at war. (5) Nevertheless, the English city of Bristol and the German city of Hanover formed a partnership in 1947, with Bristol shipping relief supplies to Hanover and Hanover sending musicians to perform in Bristol. (6) The partnership evolved to include an educational exchange that continues to give English and German students experience in another culture.</p><p>(7) Such relationships provide an important complement to diplomacy carried out between governments. (8)&nbsp;Governments can forge alliances between countries, but the particular officials charged with doing so vary from country to country. (9) What\u2019s more, as Mary Kane of Sister Cities International notes, \u201cForeign affairs doesn\u2019t have to be done just by the State Department.\u201d (10) By conveying international relations into people\u2019s lives, sister cities make connections with distant places feel real to citizens.</p><p>(11) Although the potential benefits of sister cities are great, they can\u2019t be taken for granted. (12) Without active participation from community groups, local government, and ordinary citizens, the relationships can fall into neglect.

(15)&nbsp;This dynamic is illustrated in the sister-city relationship between Muscatine, Iowa, and Zhengding County in China. (16) In 1985, Xi Jinping visited Muscatine on a research trip to study soybean farming. (17) When Xi later became president of China, his personal connection to Muscatine formed the basis for the sister-city relationship, which in turn led to Chinese investment in Muscatine\u2019s hospitality and tourism industries.</p>",

Rothfels</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In the archives of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, there is an old postcard from the city aquarium of a large sea turtle with four boys straddling its back. The turtle lies flattened upon a pathway in front of a fence. At the feet of the children, near the animal\u2019s front left flipper, is a messy coil of rope, presumably dropped after being used to hoist the turtle onto the pavement. This is a large marine turtle, barely able to move itself on land. There wouldn\u2019t have been any \u2018riding\u2019 here; just sitting on the back of an animal taken out of its tank for a photo-op. As  much as the boys are at the center of this photograph, they are not the reason for it. It is the animal that is the interesting element. The children are only there to provide scale and to help the viewer imagine the extraordinary experience of sitting on the back of something so remarkable.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The fundamental constant in most exhibitions of animals over the past couple of centuries, if not millennia, has been that people take pleasure in being close to animals. The impulse to capture, keep and show unusual, nondomestic animals seems, in fact, to go back as far as history itself. To put the point bluntly, people go to zoos today not because they want to support the conservation mission of the zoos, not because they are hoping to learn about which animal belongs to which taxonomic group, not because they are committed to supporting the scientific study of stress hormones in animal droppings, but because they think zoos are fun. </p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>What they find when they go is often not what they expected or hoped. This is not a new phenomenon: this is the very nature of these kinds of places. This is why zoos have always argued that, while they might in the past have been bad, wasteful, poorly managed places, or destructive of nature, zoos today are better \u2013 and in the future, we are assured, will be better still. At a surface level the argument is true, but at a deeper level these institutions must forever struggle with the fundamental fact that while new missions have been added to zoos over the past couple of hundred years, the essential nature of the places as sites of human amusement that depend fundamentally on  constraining the natural behaviors of other living creatures has not changed. Show me a zoo that builds an enclosure for a \u2018boring\u2019 snake \u2013 not for one of those huge, dangerous, spectacularly coloured ones \u2013 that actually meets the natural conditions of that snake in the wild rather than being a simple, small glass box, and I will be surprised. Then I will believe that the history of zoos has new stories yet to tell.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The leatherback turtle that lived for a few weeks in the New York Aquarium in 1908 is not a story of exception. It is the archetypal story of zoos themselves. The turtle was captured and then purchased by the aquarium not because it could flourish in captivity. It ended up in the zoo because it was a spectacle, because its size and the texture of its skin fascinated, because the name \u2018harp turtle\u2019 conjured poetic thoughts, because it was so big you could stick four boys on it for a photograph. It came to the aquarium in order to get people to come to the aquarium. The turtle died in the aquarium because, despite the goals of education, science and conservation, the core purpose of zoos has  always been, and will always be, simply to entertain.</p>",

Every other authour may aspire to praise; the lexicographer can only hope to escape reproach, and even this negative recompence has been yet granted to very few.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I have, notwithstanding this discouragement, attempted a dictionary of the English language, which, while it was employed in the cultivation of every species of literature, has itself been hitherto neglected, suffered to spread, under the direction of chance, into wild exuberance, resigned to the tyranny of time and fashion, and exposed to the corruptions of ignorance, and caprices of innovation. </p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When I took the first survey of my undertaking, I found our speech copious without order, and energetick [sic] without rules: wherever I turned my view, there was perplexity to be disentangled, and confusion to be regulated; choice was to be made out of boundless variety, without any established principle of selection; adulterations were to be detected, without a settled test of purity; and modes of expression to be rejected or received, without the suffrages of any writers of classical reputation or acknowledged authority.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Having therefore no assistance but from general grammar, I applied myself to the perusal of our writers; and noting whatever might be of use to ascertain or illustrate any word or phrase, accumulated in time the materials of a dictionary, which, by degrees, I reduced to method, establishing to myself, in the progress of the work, such rules as experience and analogy suggested to me; experience, which practice and observation were continually increasing; and analogy, which, though in some words obscure, was evident in others.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In adjusting the Orthography, which has been to this time unsettled and fortuitous, I found it necessary to distinguish those irregularities that are inherent in our tongue, and perhaps coeval with it, from others which the ignorance or negligence of later writers has produced. Every language has its anomalies, which, though inconvenient, and in themselves once unnecessary, must be tolerated among the imperfections of human things, and which require only to be registered; that they may not be increased, and ascertained, that they may not be confounded: but every language has likewise its improprieties and absurdities, which it is the duty of the lexicographer to correct or proscribe.</p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>As language was at its beginning merely oral, all words of necessary or common use were spoken before they were written; and while they were unfixed by any visible signs, must have been spoken with great diversity, as we now observe those who cannot read to catch sounds imperfectly, and utter them negligently. When this wild and barbarous jargon was first reduced to an alphabet, every penman endeavoured to express, as he could, the sounds which he was accustomed to pronounce or to receive, and vitiated in writing such words as were already vitiated in speech. The powers of the letters, when they were applied to a new language, must have been vague and unsettled, and therefore different hands would exhibit the same sound by different combinations.</p>",

But the fact is that the former\u2019s very helplessness makes him content to rest and not to strive.  I know a young man so helplessly deformed that he has to be carried about, who is happy in reading a little, playing chess, taking a course or two in college, and all with the sunniest goodwill in the world, and a happiness that seems strange and unaccountable to my restlessness. He does not cry for the moon.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>When one, however, is in full possession of his faculties, and can move about freely, bearing simply a crooked back and an unsightly face, he is perforce drawn into all the currents of life.  Particularly if he has his own way in the world to make, his road is apt to be hard and rugged, and he will penetrate to an unusual depth in his interpretation both of the world\u2019s attitude toward such misfortunes, and of the attitude toward the world which misfortunes tend to cultivate in men like him.  For he has all the battles of a stronger man to fight, and he is at a double disadvantage in fighting them. He has constantly with him the sense of being obliged to make extra efforts to overcome the bad impression of his physical defects, and he is haunted with a constant feeling of weakness and low vitality which makes effort more difficult and renders him easily fainthearted and discouraged by failure. He is never confident of himself, because he has grown up in an atmosphere where nobody has been very  confident of him; and yet his environment and circumstances call out all sorts of ambitions and energies in him which from the nature of his case, are bound to be immediately thwarted.  This attitude is likely to keep him at a generally low level of accomplishment unless he have an unusually strong will, and a strong will is perhaps the last thing to develop under such circumstances.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The deformed man is always conscious that the world does not expect very much from him. And it takes him a long time to see in this a challenge instead of a firm pressing down to a low level of accomplishment. As a result, he does not expect very much of himself; he is timid in approaching people, and distrustful of his ability to persuade and convince. He becomes extraordinarily sensitive to other people\u2019s first impressions of him.  Those who are to be his friends he knows instantly, and further acquaintance adds little to the intimacy and warm friendship that he at once  feels for them.  On the other hand, those who do not respond to him immediately cannot by any effort either on his part or their overcome that first alienation.</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So to all who are situated as I am, I would say \u2013 Grow up as fast as you can. Cultivate the widest interests you can, and cherish all your friends. Cultivate some artistic talent, for you will find it the most durable of satisfactions, and perhaps one the surest means of livelihood as well. Achievement is, of course, on the knees of the gods; but you will at least have the thrill of a trial, and, after all, not to try is to fail. Taking your disabilities for granted, and assuming constantly that they are being taken for granted, make your social intercourse as broad and as constant as possible. Do not take the world too seriously, nor let too many social conventions oppress you. Keep sweet your sense of humor, and above all do not let any morbid feelings of inferiority creep into your soul. You will find yourself sensitive enough to the sympathy of others, and if you do not find people who like you and are willing to meet you more than halfway, it will be because you have let your disability narrow your vision and shrink up your soul. It will be really your own fault, and not that of your circumstances. In a word, keep looking outward; look out eagerly for those things that interest you, for people who will interest you and be friends with you, for new interests and for opportunities to express yourself.  You will find that your disability will come to have little meaning for you, that it will begin to fade quite completely out of your sight; you will wake up some fine morning and find yourself, after all the struggles that seemed so bitter to you, really and truly adjusted to the world.</p>",

The bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that minute that that occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who bends not his ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? But who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world? </p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. </p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Neither can we call this a begging of misery or a borrowing of misery, as though we are not miserable enough of ourselves but must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the misery of our neighbors. Truly it were an excusable covetousness if we did; for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath enough of it. </p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction. If a man carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none coined into current moneys, his treasure will not defray him as he travels. Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our home, heaven, by it. Another man may be sick too, and sick to death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels as gold in a mine and be of no use to him; but this bell that tells me of his affliction digs out and applies that gold to me, if by this consideration of another's dangers I take mine own into contemplation and so secure myself by making my recourse to my God, who is our only security.</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>We Want Change, Pope Francis, 2015  </em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Several months ago, we met in Rome, and I remember that first meeting. In the meantime I have kept you in my thoughts and prayers. I am happy to see you again, here, as you discuss the best ways to overcome the grave situations of injustice experienced by the excluded  throughout our world. During our first meeting in Rome, I sensed something very beautiful:  fraternity, determination, commitment, a thirst for justice. Today, in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, I sense it once again. I thank you for that. </p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Today God has granted that we meet again. The Bible tells us that God hears the cry of his people, and I wish to join my voice to yours in calling for land, lodging and labor for all our  brothers and sisters. I said it and I repeat it: these are sacred rights. It is important, it is well worth fighting for them. May the cry of the excluded be heard in Latin America and throughout the world. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Let us begin by acknowledging that change is needed. ...Do we realize that something is wrong in a world where there are so many farmworkers without land, so many families without a home, so many laborers without rights, so many persons whose dignity is not respected? Do we realize that something is wrong where so many senseless wars are being fought and acts of fratricidal violence are taking place on our very doorstep? Do we realize something is wrong when the soil, water, air and living creatures of our world are under constant threat?</p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So let\u2019s not be afraid to say it: we need change; we want change. We want change in our lives, in our neighborhoods, in our everyday reality. We want a change which can affect the entire world, since global interdependence calls for global answers to local problems. The globalization of hope, a hope which springs up from peoples and takes root among the poor, must replace the globalization of exclusion and indifference!</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Each day you are caught up in the storms of people\u2019s lives. You have told me about their causes, you have shared your own struggles with me, and I thank you for that. You, dear brothers and sisters, often work on little things, in local situations, amid forms of injustice which you do not simply accept but actively resist, standing up to an idolatrous system which excludes, debases and kills... You have also promoted any number of community activities aimed at reaffirming so elementary and undeniably necessary a right as that of the three \u201cL\u2019s\u201d: land, lodging and labor.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This rootedness in the barrio, the land, the office, the labor union, this ability to see yourselves in the faces of others, this daily proximity to their share of troubles and their little acts of heroism: this is what enables you to practice the commandment of love, not on the basis of ideas or concepts, but rather on the basis of genuine interpersonal encounter... From those seeds of hope patiently sown in the forgotten fringes of our planet, from those seedlings of a tenderness which struggles to grow amid the shadows of exclusion, great trees will spring up, great groves of hope to give oxygen to our world.</p> <p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Working for a just distribution of the fruits of the earth and human labor is not mere philanthropy... it is a commandment. It is about giving to the poor and to peoples what is theirs by right. The universal destination of goods is not a figure of speech found in the Church\u2019s social teaching. It is a reality prior to private property. Property, especially when it affects natural resources, must always serve the needs of peoples. And those needs are not restricted to consumption. It is not enough to let a few drops fall whenever the poor shake a cup which never runs over by itself. Welfare programs geared to certain emergencies can only be considered temporary responses. They will never be able to replace true inclusion...</p> <p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>In conclusion, I would like to repeat: the future of humanity does not lie solely in the hands of great leaders, the great powers and the elites. It is fundamentally in the hands of peoples and  in their ability to organize. It is in their hands, which can guide with humility and conviction this process of change. I am with you. Let us together say from the heart: no family without lodging, no rural worker without land, no laborer without rights, no people without sovereignty, no individual without dignity, no child without childhood, no young person without a future, no elderly person without a venerable old age. </p> <p><em>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Keep up your struggle and, please, take great care of Mother Earth. I pray for you and with you, and I ask God our Father to accompany you and to bless you, to fill you with his love and defend you on your way by granting you in abundance that strength which keeps us on our feet: that strength is hope, the hope which does not disappoint. Thank you and I ask you, please, to pray for me.</p>",

I instantly had two responses, one helpful, one not. On the one hand, I would tell my younger self that she should stop listening to anyone who wanted to smack her down, that she was smart enough, resourceful and hardworking enough, pretty terrific in general. On the other hand, I would have to break the bad news: that she knew nothing, really, about anything that mattered. Nothing at all. Not  a clue.</p><p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>You don't know what you don't know when you're young. How could you? People who are older nod sagely and say you'll learn - about love, about marriage, about failing and falling down and getting up and trying to stagger on toward success, about work and children and what really matters, in general and to you. It's not, they'll say, what's on your business card, at a moment when you don't even have a business card. I recall hearing this message  constantly when I was younger, and thinking that I was getting older as fast as I could. In retrospect this seems a bit of a shame as well as a vainglorious task. You're like a cake when you're young. You can't rush it or it will fall, or just turn out wrong. Rising takes patience, and heat.</p><p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>It's nothing short of astonishing, all that we learn between the time we are born and the time we die. Of course most of the learning takes place not in a classroom or a library, but in the laboratory of our own lives. We can look  back and identify moments - the friend's betrayal, the work advancement or failure, the wrong turn or the romantic misstep, the careless comment.</p><p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But it's all a continuum that is clear only in hindsight, frequently when some of its lessons may not even be useful anymore.</p><p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Maybe that's why we give advice, when we're older, mostly to people who don't want to hear it. They can't hear it  because it's in a different language, a language we learn over time, the language of experience cut with failure, triumph, and tedium. We finally understand childrearing when our children are grown. We look back on our work and know now how we would have altered plans and strategies, realize that some of what seemed inevitable at the time could have been altered, different.</p><p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>We understand ourselves, our lives, retrospectively. </p><p><em>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>There comes that moment when we finally know what matters and, perhaps more important, what doesn't, when we see that all the life lessons came not from what we had but from who we loved, and from the failures perhaps more than the successes.</p><p><em>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I would tell my twenty-two-year-old self that what lasts are things so ordinary she may not even see them: Family dinners, fair fights, phone calls, friends. But of course the young woman I once was cannot hear me, not just because of time and space but because of the language, and the lessons, she has yet to learn. It's a miracle: somehow over time she learned them all just the same, by trial and error.</p>",

(2)&nbsp;Because Netflix offers viewers the choice of subtitles or dubbing for foreign-language content, film buffs are debating the question of which format is better. (3)&nbsp;Subtitles provide a translation of the spoken dialogue, appearing as text at the bottom of the screen, and dubbing involves replacing the dialogue in the original soundtrack with rerecorded dialogue in a different language. (4) While dubbing may cater to the casual television viewer, subtitling provides a more authentic, immersive viewing experience that serious film watchers should embrace.</p><p>(5) In the United States, dubbing has commonly been reserved for children\u2019s media, particularly animated content\u2014and for good reason. (6) Dubbing can be distracting in live-action content because either the voices don\u2019t match the actors\u2019 appearances or the dubbed dialogue is poorly synced to the actors\u2019 mouth movements. (7) With animation, dubbing is less noticeable, and children can enjoy the story more easily. (8) Discerning adult viewers, likewise, typically choose subtitles whenever possible. (9) According to one television critic, subtitles better preserve the \u201coriginal rhythms of the scene\u201d and, after a while, the critic forgets he\u2019s even reading them. (10) Another critic argues that \u201cyou really do want to concentrate on the actor\u2019s WHOLE performance,\u201d including the speaking, instead of hearing another performer\u2019s voice dubbed over the actor\u2019s. (11)&nbsp;Additionally, subtitles are typically more accurate translations than dubs, better preserving the actors\u2019 subtle humor or character quirks.</p><p>(12) General audiences, according to Netflix, still prefer dubs. (13) The company now defaults to dubbing because its data indicate that viewers are more likely to finish a movie or show if it\u2019s presented in the viewer\u2019s native language. (14) These viewers say they prefer to unwind while watching television, which is easier to do when a movie is dubbed. (15) Surprisingly, even some television critics admit that they prefer dubs so they can do other things while watching, like check their phones or wash the dishes. (16) Therein lies the crucial distinction: because subtitles demand constant attention, dubbing allows for shorter attention spans and multitasking while viewing.</p>",

All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here. The shoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing, cartwrighting, coopering, weaving, and grain-grinding, were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation. The whole place wore a business-like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms. The number of houses, too, conspired to give it advantage over the neighboring farms. It was called by the slaves the GREAT HOUSE FARM. Few privileges were esteemed higher, by the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being selected to do errands at the Great House Farm. It was associated in their minds with greatness. A representative could not be prouder of his election to a seat in the American Congress, than a slave on one of the out-farms would be of his election to do errands at the Great House Farm.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>They regarded it as evidence of great confidence reposed in them by their overseers; and it was on this account, as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver's lash, that they esteemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living for. He was called the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor conferred upon him the most frequently. The competitors for this office sought as diligently to please their overseers, as the office-seekers in the political parties seek to please and deceive the people. The same traits of character might be seen in Colonel Lloyd's slaves, as are seen in the slaves of the political parties. </p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm, for the monthly allowance for themselves and their fellow-slaves, were peculiarly enthusiastic. While on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness. They would compose and sing as they went along, consulting neither time nor tune. The thought that came up, came out \u2014 if not in the word, in the sound; \u2014 and as frequently in the one as in the other. They would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone. Into all of their songs they would manage to weave something of the Great House Farm. Especially would they do this, when leaving home. They would then sing most exultingly the following words: \u2014 \"I am going away to the Great House Farm!  O, yea! O, yea! O!\" </p> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>This they would sing, as a chorus, to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do. </p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequently found myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd's plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul, \u2014 and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because \"there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.\" </p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>I have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to find persons who could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their contentment and happiness. It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake. Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy. The songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears. At least, such is my experience. I have often sung to drown my sorrow, but seldom to express my happiness. Crying for joy, and singing for joy, were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slavery. The singing of a man cast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered as evidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the songs of the one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion.</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>From Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, Siddhartha Mukherjee</em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The notion of cancer as an affliction that belongs paradigmatically to the twentieth century is reminiscent, as Susan Sontag argued so powerfully in her book <u>Illness as Metaphor</u>, of another disease once considered emblematic of another era: tuberculosis in the nineteenth century. Both diseases, as Sontag pointedly noted, were similarly \u201cobscene\u2014in the original meaning of that word: ill-omened, abominable, repugnant to the senses.\u201d Both drain vitality; both stretch out the encounter with death; in both cases, dying, even more  than death, defines the illness.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>But despite such parallels, tuberculosis belongs to another country. TB (or consumption) was Victorian Romanticism brought to its pathological extreme\u2014febrile, unrelenting, breathless, and obsessive. It was a disease of poets: John Keats involuting silently toward death in a small room overlooking the Spanish Steps in Rome, or Byron, an obsessive romantic, who fantasized  about dying of the disease to impress his mistresses. \u201cDeath and disease are  often beautiful, like . . . the hectic glow of consumption,\u201d Thoreau wrote in 1852. In Thomas Mann\u2019s <u>The Magic Mountain</u>, this \u201chectic glow\u201d releases a feverish creative force in its victims\u2014a clarifying, edifying, cathartic force that, too, appears to be charged with the essence of its era.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Cancer, in contrast, is riddled with more contemporary images. The cancer cell is desperate individualist, \u201cin every possible sense, a nonconformist,\u201d as the surgeon-writer Sherwin Nuland wrote. The word *metastasis*, used to describe the migration of cancer from one site to another, is a curious mix of meta and stasis\u2014\u201cbeyond stillness\u201d in Latin\u2014an unmoored, partially unstable state that  captures the peculiar instability of modernity. If consumption once killed its  victims by pathological evisceration (the tuberculosis bascillus gradually hollows out the lung), then cancer asphyxiates us by filling bodies with too many cells; it is consumption in its alternate meaning\u2014the pathology of excess. Cancer is an expansionist disease; it invades through tissues, sets up colonies in hostile landscapes, seeking \u201csanctuary\u201d in one organ and then immigrating to another. It lives desperately, inventively, fiercely, territorially, cannily, and defensively\u2014at times, as if teaching us how to survive. To confront cancer is to encounter a parallel species, one perhaps  more adapted to survival than even we are.</p>",

        "text": "<span><em>Was the World Made for Man?, Mark Twain, 1903  </em></span><p><em>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The Palaeozoic time-limit having now been reached, it was necessary to begin the next stage in the preparation of the world for man, by opening up the Mesozoic Age and instituting some reptiles. For man would need reptiles. Not to eat, but to develop himself from. This being the most important detail of the scheme, a spacious liberality of time was set apart for it \u2013 thirty million years. What wonders followed! From the remaining ganoids and asteroids and alkaloids were developed by slow and steady and pains-taking culture those stupendous saurians that used to prowl about the steamy world in those remote ages, with their snaky heads reared forty feet in the air and sixty feet of body and tail racing and thrashing after. All gone, now, alas \u2014 all extinct, except the little handful of  Arkansawrians left stranded and lonely with us here upon this far-flung verge and fringe of time.</p> <p><em>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Yes, it took thirty million years and twenty million reptiles to get one that would stick long enough to develop into something else and let the scheme proceed to the next step.</p> <p><em>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Then the Pterodactyl burst upon the world in all his impressive solemnity and grandeur, and all Nature recognized that the Cainozoic threshold was crossed and a new Period open for business, a new stage begun in the preparation of the globe for man. It may be that the Pterodactyl thought the thirty million years had been intended as a preparation for himself, for there was nothing too foolish for a Pterodactyl to imagine, but he was in error, the preparation was for man. Without doubt the Pterodactyl attracted great attention, for even the least observant could see that there was the making of a bird in him. And so it turned out. Also the makings of a mammal, in time. One  thing we have to say to his credit, that in the matter of picturesqueness he was the triumph of his  Period; he wore wings and had teeth, and was a starchy and wonderful mixture altogether, a kind of long-distance premonitory symptom of Kipling's marine:</p> <blockquote>\u2018\u2019E isn\u2019t one O\u2019the reg\u2019lar Line, <br/>nor \u2019e isn\u2019t one of the crew, <br/>\u2019E\u2019s a kind of a giddy harumfrodite [hermaphrodite] \u2014 <br/>soldier an\u2019 sailor too!\" </blockquote> <p><em>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>From this time onward for nearly another thirty million years the preparation moved briskly. From the Pterodactyl was developed the bird; from the bird the kangaroo, from the kangaroo the other  marsupials; from these the mastodon, the megatherium, the giant sloth, the Irish elk, and all that  crowd that you make useful and instructive fossils out of \u2014 then came the first great Ice Sheet, and they all retreated before it and crossed over the bridge at Behring\u2019s strait and wandered around over Europe and Asia and died. All except a few, to carry on the preparation with. Six Glacial Periods with two million years between Periods chased these poor orphans up and down and about the earth, from weather to weather \u2014 from tropic swelter at the poles to Arctic frost at the equator and back again and to and fro, they never knowing what kind of weather was going to turn up next; and if ever they settled down anywhere the whole continent suddenly sank under them without the least notice and they had to trade places with the fishes and scramble off to where the seas had been, and scarcely a dry rag on them; and when there was nothing else doing a volcano would let go  and fire them out from wherever they had located. They led this unsettled and irritating life for  twenty-five million years, half the time afloat, half the time aground, and always wondering what it was all for, they never suspecting, of course, that it was a preparation for man and had to be done just so or it wouldn\u2019t be any proper and harmonious place for him when he arrived.</p> <p><em>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And at last came the monkey, and anybody could see that man wasn\u2019t far off, now. And in truth that was so. The monkey went on developing for close upon 5,000,000 years, and then turned into a man \u2014  to all appearances.</p> <p><em>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>Such is the history of it. Man has been here 32,000 years. That it took a hundred million years to prepare the world  for him is proof that that is what it was done for. I suppose it is. I dunno. If the Eiffel tower were now representing the world\u2019s age, the skin of paint on the pinnacle-knob at its  summit would represent man\u2019s share of that age; and anybody would perceive that that skin was what the tower was built for. I reckon they would, I dunno.</p>",
